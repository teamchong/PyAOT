{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Before we proceed any further, hear me speak."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Speak, speak."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Resolved. resolved."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "We know't, we know't."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price."}
{"text": "Is't a verdict?"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "One word, good citizens."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good."}
{"text": "What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they"}
{"text": "would yield us but the superfluity, while it were"}
{"text": "wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;"}
{"text": "but they think we are too dear: the leanness that"}
{"text": "afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an"}
{"text": "inventory to particularise their abundance; our"}
{"text": "sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with"}
{"text": "our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I"}
{"text": "speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Consider you what services he has done for his country?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Very well; and could be content to give him good"}
{"text": "report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Nay, but speak not maliciously."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did"}
{"text": "it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be"}
{"text": "content to say it was for his country he did it to"}
{"text": "please his mother and to be partly proud; which he"}
{"text": "is, even till the altitude of his virtue."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "What he cannot help in his nature, you account a"}
{"text": "vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;"}
{"text": "he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition."}
{"text": "What shouts are these? The other side o' the city"}
{"text": "is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Come, come."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Soft! who comes here?"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved"}
{"text": "the people."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you"}
{"text": "With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have"}
{"text": "had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,"}
{"text": "which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor"}
{"text": "suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we"}
{"text": "have strong arms too."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,"}
{"text": "Will you undo yourselves?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "We cannot, sir, we are undone already."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I tell you, friends, most charitable care"}
{"text": "Have the patricians of you. For your wants,"}
{"text": "Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well"}
{"text": "Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them"}
{"text": "Against the Roman state, whose course will on"}
{"text": "The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs"}
{"text": "Of more strong link asunder than can ever"}
{"text": "Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,"}
{"text": "The gods, not the patricians, make it, and"}
{"text": "Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,"}
{"text": "You are transported by calamity"}
{"text": "Thither where more attends you, and you slander"}
{"text": "The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,"}
{"text": "When you curse them as enemies."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us"}
{"text": "yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses"}
{"text": "crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to"}
{"text": "support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act"}
{"text": "established against the rich, and provide more"}
{"text": "piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain"}
{"text": "the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and"}
{"text": "there's all the love they bear us."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Either you must"}
{"text": "Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,"}
{"text": "Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you"}
{"text": "A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;"}
{"text": "But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture"}
{"text": "To stale 't a little more."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to"}
{"text": "fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please"}
{"text": "you, deliver."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "There was a time when all the body's members"}
{"text": "Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:"}
{"text": "That only like a gulf it did remain"}
{"text": "I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,"}
{"text": "Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing"}
{"text": "Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments"}
{"text": "Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,"}
{"text": "And, mutually participate, did minister"}
{"text": "Unto the appetite and affection common"}
{"text": "Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Well, sir, what answer made the belly?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,"}
{"text": "Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--"}
{"text": "For, look you, I may make the belly smile"}
{"text": "As well as speak--it tauntingly replied"}
{"text": "To the discontented members, the mutinous parts"}
{"text": "That envied his receipt; even so most fitly"}
{"text": "As you malign our senators for that"}
{"text": "They are not such as you."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Your belly's answer? What!"}
{"text": "The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,"}
{"text": "The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,"}
{"text": "Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter."}
{"text": "With other muniments and petty helps"}
{"text": "In this our fabric, if that they--"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What then?"}
{"text": "'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,"}
{"text": "Who is the sink o' the body,--"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Well, what then?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "The former agents, if they did complain,"}
{"text": "What could the belly answer?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I will tell you"}
{"text": "If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--"}
{"text": "Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Ye're long about it."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Note me this, good friend;"}
{"text": "Your most grave belly was deliberate,"}
{"text": "Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:"}
{"text": "'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,"}
{"text": "'That I receive the general food at first,"}
{"text": "Which you do live upon; and fit it is,"}
{"text": "Because I am the store-house and the shop"}
{"text": "Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,"}
{"text": "I send it through the rivers of your blood,"}
{"text": "Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;"}
{"text": "And, through the cranks and offices of man,"}
{"text": "The strongest nerves and small inferior veins"}
{"text": "From me receive that natural competency"}
{"text": "Whereby they live: and though that all at once,"}
{"text": "You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir; well, well."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "'Though all at once cannot"}
{"text": "See what I do deliver out to each,"}
{"text": "Yet I can make my audit up, that all"}
{"text": "From me do back receive the flour of all,"}
{"text": "And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "It was an answer: how apply you this?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The senators of Rome are this good belly,"}
{"text": "And you the mutinous members; for examine"}
{"text": "Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly"}
{"text": "Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find"}
{"text": "No public benefit which you receive"}
{"text": "But it proceeds or comes from them to you"}
{"text": "And no way from yourselves. What do you think,"}
{"text": "You, the great toe of this assembly?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "I the great toe! why the great toe?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,"}
{"text": "Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:"}
{"text": "Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,"}
{"text": "Lead'st first to win some vantage."}
{"text": "But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:"}
{"text": "Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;"}
{"text": "The one side must have bale."}
{"text": "Hail, noble Marcius!"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,"}
{"text": "That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,"}
{"text": "Make yourselves scabs?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "We have ever your good word."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "He that will give good words to thee will flatter"}
{"text": "Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,"}
{"text": "That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,"}
{"text": "The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,"}
{"text": "Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;"}
{"text": "Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,"}
{"text": "Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,"}
{"text": "Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is"}
{"text": "To make him worthy whose offence subdues him"}
{"text": "And curse that justice did it."}
{"text": "Who deserves greatness"}
{"text": "Deserves your hate; and your affections are"}
{"text": "A sick man's appetite, who desires most that"}
{"text": "Which would increase his evil. He that depends"}
{"text": "Upon your favours swims with fins of lead"}
{"text": "And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?"}
{"text": "With every minute you do change a mind,"}
{"text": "And call him noble that was now your hate,"}
{"text": "Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,"}
{"text": "That in these several places of the city"}
{"text": "You cry against the noble senate, who,"}
{"text": "Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else"}
{"text": "Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,"}
{"text": "The city is well stored."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Hang 'em! They say!"}
{"text": "They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know"}
{"text": "What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,"}
{"text": "Who thrives and who declines; side factions"}
{"text": "and give out"}
{"text": "Conjectural marriages; making parties strong"}
{"text": "And feebling such as stand not in their liking"}
{"text": "Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's"}
{"text": "grain enough!"}
{"text": "Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,"}
{"text": "And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry"}
{"text": "With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high"}
{"text": "As I could pick my lance."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;"}
{"text": "For though abundantly they lack discretion,"}
{"text": "Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,"}
{"text": "What says the other troop?"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "They are dissolved: hang 'em!"}
{"text": "They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,"}
{"text": "That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,"}
{"text": "That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not"}
{"text": "Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds"}
{"text": "They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,"}
{"text": "And a petition granted them, a strange one--"}
{"text": "To break the heart of generosity,"}
{"text": "And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps"}
{"text": "As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,"}
{"text": "Shouting their emulation."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What is granted them?"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,"}
{"text": "Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,"}
{"text": "Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!"}
{"text": "The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,"}
{"text": "Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time"}
{"text": "Win upon power and throw forth greater themes"}
{"text": "For insurrection's arguing."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "This is strange."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Go, get you home, you fragments!"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Where's Caius Marcius?"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Here: what's the matter?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent"}
{"text": "Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;"}
{"text": "The Volsces are in arms."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "They have a leader,"}
{"text": "Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't."}
{"text": "I sin in envying his nobility,"}
{"text": "And were I any thing but what I am,"}
{"text": "I would wish me only he."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "You have fought together."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Were half to half the world by the ears and he."}
{"text": "Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make"}
{"text": "Only my wars with him: he is a lion"}
{"text": "That I am proud to hunt."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Then, worthy Marcius,"}
{"text": "Attend upon Cominius to these wars."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "It is your former promise."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, it is;"}
{"text": "And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou"}
{"text": "Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face."}
{"text": "What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?"}
{"text": "TITUS:"}
{"text": "No, Caius Marcius;"}
{"text": "I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,"}
{"text": "Ere stay behind this business."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "O, true-bred!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,"}
{"text": "Our greatest friends attend us."}
{"text": "TITUS:"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Noble Marcius!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, let them follow:"}
{"text": "The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither"}
{"text": "To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,"}
{"text": "Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "He has no equal."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Mark'd you his lip and eyes?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay. but his taunts."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Be-mock the modest moon."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "The present wars devour him: he is grown"}
{"text": "Too proud to be so valiant."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Such a nature,"}
{"text": "Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow"}
{"text": "Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder"}
{"text": "His insolence can brook to be commanded"}
{"text": "Under Cominius."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Fame, at the which he aims,"}
{"text": "In whom already he's well graced, can not"}
{"text": "Better be held nor more attain'd than by"}
{"text": "A place below the first: for what miscarries"}
{"text": "Shall be the general's fault, though he perform"}
{"text": "To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure"}
{"text": "Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he"}
{"text": "Had borne the business!'"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Besides, if things go well,"}
{"text": "Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall"}
{"text": "Of his demerits rob Cominius."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Come:"}
{"text": "Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius."}
{"text": "Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults"}
{"text": "To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed"}
{"text": "In aught he merit not."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Let's hence, and hear"}
{"text": "How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,"}
{"text": "More than his singularity, he goes"}
{"text": "Upon this present action."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Lets along."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "So, your opinion is, Aufidius,"}
{"text": "That they of Rome are entered in our counsels"}
{"text": "And know how we proceed."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Is it not yours?"}
{"text": "What ever have been thought on in this state,"}
{"text": "That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome"}
{"text": "Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone"}
{"text": "Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think"}
{"text": "I have the letter here; yes, here it is."}
{"text": "'They have press'd a power, but it is not known"}
{"text": "Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;"}
{"text": "The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,"}
{"text": "Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,"}
{"text": "Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,"}
{"text": "And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,"}
{"text": "These three lead on this preparation"}
{"text": "Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:"}
{"text": "Consider of it.'"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Our army's in the field"}
{"text": "We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready"}
{"text": "To answer us."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Nor did you think it folly"}
{"text": "To keep your great pretences veil'd till when"}
{"text": "They needs must show themselves; which"}
{"text": "in the hatching,"}
{"text": "It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery."}
{"text": "We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was"}
{"text": "To take in many towns ere almost Rome"}
{"text": "Should know we were afoot."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Noble Aufidius,"}
{"text": "Take your commission; hie you to your bands:"}
{"text": "Let us alone to guard Corioli:"}
{"text": "If they set down before 's, for the remove"}
{"text": "Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find"}
{"text": "They've not prepared for us."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "O, doubt not that;"}
{"text": "I speak from certainties. Nay, more,"}
{"text": "Some parcels of their power are forth already,"}
{"text": "And only hitherward. I leave your honours."}
{"text": "If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,"}
{"text": "'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike"}
{"text": "Till one can do no more."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "The gods assist you!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "And keep your honours safe!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Farewell."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Farewell."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Farewell."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a"}
{"text": "more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I"}
{"text": "should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he"}
{"text": "won honour than in the embracements of his bed where"}
{"text": "he would show most love. When yet he was but"}
{"text": "tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when"}
{"text": "youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when"}
{"text": "for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not"}
{"text": "sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering"}
{"text": "how honour would become such a person. that it was"}
{"text": "no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if"}
{"text": "renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek"}
{"text": "danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel"}
{"text": "war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows"}
{"text": "bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not"}
{"text": "more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child"}
{"text": "than now in first seeing he had proved himself a"}
{"text": "man."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "But had he died in the business, madam; how then?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Then his good report should have been my son; I"}
{"text": "therein would have found issue. Hear me profess"}
{"text": "sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love"}
{"text": "alike and none less dear than thine and my good"}
{"text": "Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their"}
{"text": "country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action."}
{"text": "Gentlewoman:"}
{"text": "Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Indeed, you shall not."}
{"text": "Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,"}
{"text": "See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,"}
{"text": "As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:"}
{"text": "Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:"}
{"text": "'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,"}
{"text": "Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow"}
{"text": "With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,"}
{"text": "Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow"}
{"text": "Or all or lose his hire."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Away, you fool! it more becomes a man"}
{"text": "Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,"}
{"text": "When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier"}
{"text": "Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood"}
{"text": "At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,"}
{"text": "We are fit to bid her welcome."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee"}
{"text": "And tread upon his neck."}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "My ladies both, good day to you."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Sweet madam."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "I am glad to see your ladyship."}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers."}
{"text": "What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good"}
{"text": "faith. How does your little son?"}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "I thank your ladyship; well, good madam."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than"}
{"text": "look upon his school-master."}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a"}
{"text": "very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'"}
{"text": "Wednesday half an hour together: has such a"}
{"text": "confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded"}
{"text": "butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go"}
{"text": "again; and after it again; and over and over he"}
{"text": "comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his"}
{"text": "fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his"}
{"text": "teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked"}
{"text": "it!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "One on 's father's moods."}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "A crack, madam."}

{"text": "Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,"}
{"text": "you must go visit the good lady that lies in."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with"}

{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Why, I pray you?"}

{"text": "O, good madam, there can be none yet."}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from"}
{"text": "him last night."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "Indeed, madam?"}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it."}
{"text": "Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against"}
{"text": "whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of"}
{"text": "our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set"}
{"text": "down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt"}

{"text": "My horse to yours, no."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis done."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Agreed."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Say, has our general met the enemy?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "So, the good horse is mine."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll buy him of you."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will"}
{"text": "For half a hundred years. Summon the town."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "How far off lie these armies?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Within this mile and half."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours."}
{"text": "Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,"}
{"text": "That we with smoking swords may march from hence,"}
{"text": "To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast."}
{"text": "Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "No, nor a man that fears you less than he,"}
{"text": "That's lesser than a little."}
{"text": "Hark! our drums"}
{"text": "Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,"}
{"text": "Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,"}
{"text": "Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;"}
{"text": "They'll open of themselves."}
{"text": "Hark you. far off!"}
{"text": "There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes"}
{"text": "Amongst your cloven army."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "O, they are at it!"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "They fear us not, but issue forth their city."}
{"text": "Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight"}
{"text": "With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,"}
{"text": "brave Titus:"}
{"text": "They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,"}
{"text": "Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:"}
{"text": "He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,"}
{"text": "And he shall feel mine edge."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "All the contagion of the south light on you,"}
{"text": "You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues"}
{"text": "Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd"}
{"text": "Further than seen and one infect another"}
{"text": "Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,"}
{"text": "That bear the shapes of men, how have you run"}
{"text": "From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!"}
{"text": "All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale"}
{"text": "With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,"}
{"text": "Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe"}
{"text": "And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;"}
{"text": "If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,"}
{"text": "As they us to our trenches followed."}
{"text": "So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:"}
{"text": "'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,"}
{"text": "Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "Fool-hardiness; not I."}
{"text": "Second Soldier:"}
{"text": "Nor I."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "See, they have shut him in."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "To the pot, I warrant him."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "What is become of Marcius?"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Slain, sir, doubtless."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "Following the fliers at the very heels,"}
{"text": "With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,"}
{"text": "Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,"}
{"text": "To answer all the city."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "O noble fellow!"}
{"text": "Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,"}
{"text": "And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:"}
{"text": "A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,"}
{"text": "Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier"}
{"text": "Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible"}
{"text": "Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and"}
{"text": "The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,"}
{"text": "Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world"}
{"text": "Were feverous and did tremble."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "Look, sir."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "O,'tis Marcius!"}
{"text": "Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike."}
{"text": "First Roman:"}
{"text": "This will I carry to Rome."}
{"text": "Second Roman:"}
{"text": "And I this."}
{"text": "Third Roman:"}
{"text": "A murrain on't! I took this for silver."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "See here these movers that do prize their hours"}
{"text": "At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,"}
{"text": "Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would"}
{"text": "Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,"}
{"text": "Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!"}
{"text": "And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!"}
{"text": "There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,"}
{"text": "Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take"}
{"text": "Convenient numbers to make good the city;"}
{"text": "Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste"}
{"text": "To help Cominius."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;"}
{"text": "Thy exercise hath been too violent for"}
{"text": "A second course of fight."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, praise me not;"}
{"text": "My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:"}
{"text": "The blood I drop is rather physical"}
{"text": "Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus"}
{"text": "I will appear, and fight."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Now the fair goddess, Fortune,"}
{"text": "Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms"}
{"text": "Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,"}
{"text": "Prosperity be thy page!"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Thy friend no less"}
{"text": "Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Thou worthiest Marcius!"}
{"text": "Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;"}
{"text": "Call thither all the officers o' the town,"}
{"text": "Where they shall know our mind: away!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Breathe you, my friends: well fought;"}
{"text": "we are come off"}
{"text": "Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,"}
{"text": "Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,"}
{"text": "We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,"}
{"text": "By interims and conveying gusts we have heard"}
{"text": "The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!"}
{"text": "Lead their successes as we wish our own,"}
{"text": "That both our powers, with smiling"}
{"text": "fronts encountering,"}
{"text": "May give you thankful sacrifice."}
{"text": "Thy news?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The citizens of Corioli have issued,"}
{"text": "And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:"}
{"text": "I saw our party to their trenches driven,"}
{"text": "And then I came away."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Though thou speak'st truth,"}
{"text": "Methinks thou speak'st not well."}
{"text": "How long is't since?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Above an hour, my lord."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:"}
{"text": "How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,"}
{"text": "And bring thy news so late?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Spies of the Volsces"}
{"text": "Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel"}
{"text": "Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,"}
{"text": "Half an hour since brought my report."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Who's yonder,"}
{"text": "That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods"}
{"text": "He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have"}
{"text": "Before-time seen him thus."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour"}
{"text": "More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue"}
{"text": "From every meaner man."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Come I too late?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,"}
{"text": "But mantled in your own."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "O, let me clip ye"}
{"text": "In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart"}
{"text": "As merry as when our nuptial day was done,"}
{"text": "And tapers burn'd to bedward!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Flower of warriors,"}
{"text": "How is it with Titus Lartius?"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "As with a man busied about decrees:"}
{"text": "Condemning some to death, and some to exile;"}
{"text": "Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;"}
{"text": "Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,"}
{"text": "Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,"}
{"text": "To let him slip at will."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Where is that slave"}
{"text": "Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?"}
{"text": "Where is he? call him hither."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Let him alone;"}
{"text": "He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,"}
{"text": "The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--"}
{"text": "The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge"}
{"text": "From rascals worse than they."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "But how prevail'd you?"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Will the time serve to tell? I do not think."}
{"text": "Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?"}
{"text": "If not, why cease you till you are so?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Marcius,"}
{"text": "We have at disadvantage fought and did"}
{"text": "Retire to win our purpose."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "How lies their battle? know you on which side"}
{"text": "They have placed their men of trust?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "As I guess, Marcius,"}
{"text": "Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,"}
{"text": "Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,"}
{"text": "Their very heart of hope."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I do beseech you,"}
{"text": "By all the battles wherein we have fought,"}
{"text": "By the blood we have shed together, by the vows"}
{"text": "We have made to endure friends, that you directly"}
{"text": "Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;"}
{"text": "And that you not delay the present, but,"}
{"text": "Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,"}
{"text": "We prove this very hour."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Though I could wish"}
{"text": "You were conducted to a gentle bath"}
{"text": "And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never"}
{"text": "Deny your asking: take your choice of those"}
{"text": "That best can aid your action."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Those are they"}
{"text": "That most are willing. If any such be here--"}
{"text": "As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting"}
{"text": "Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear"}
{"text": "Lesser his person than an ill report;"}
{"text": "If any think brave death outweighs bad life"}
{"text": "And that his country's dearer than himself;"}
{"text": "Let him alone, or so many so minded,"}
{"text": "Wave thus, to express his disposition,"}
{"text": "And follow Marcius."}
{"text": "O, me alone! make you a sword of me?"}
{"text": "If these shows be not outward, which of you"}
{"text": "But is four Volsces? none of you but is"}
{"text": "Able to bear against the great Aufidius"}
{"text": "A shield as hard as his. A certain number,"}
{"text": "Though thanks to all, must I select"}
{"text": "from all: the rest"}
{"text": "Shall bear the business in some other fight,"}
{"text": "As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;"}
{"text": "And four shall quickly draw out my command,"}
{"text": "Which men are best inclined."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "March on, my fellows:"}
{"text": "Make good this ostentation, and you shall"}
{"text": "Divide in all with us."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,"}
{"text": "As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch"}
{"text": "Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve"}
{"text": "For a short holding: if we lose the field,"}
{"text": "We cannot keep the town."}
{"text": "Lieutenant:"}
{"text": "Fear not our care, sir."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Hence, and shut your gates upon's."}
{"text": "Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee"}
{"text": "Worse than a promise-breaker."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "We hate alike:"}
{"text": "Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor"}
{"text": "More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Let the first budger die the other's slave,"}
{"text": "And the gods doom him after!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "If I fly, Marcius,"}
{"text": "Holloa me like a hare."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Within these three hours, Tullus,"}
{"text": "Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,"}
{"text": "And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood"}
{"text": "Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge"}
{"text": "Wrench up thy power to the highest."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Wert thou the Hector"}
{"text": "That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,"}
{"text": "Thou shouldst not scape me here."}
{"text": "Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me"}
{"text": "In your condemned seconds."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,"}
{"text": "Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it"}
{"text": "Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,"}
{"text": "Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,"}
{"text": "I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,"}
{"text": "And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the"}
{"text": "dull tribunes,"}
{"text": "That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,"}
{"text": "Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods"}
{"text": "Our Rome hath such a soldier.'"}
{"text": "Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,"}
{"text": "Having fully dined before."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "O general,"}
{"text": "Here is the steed, we the caparison:"}
{"text": "Hadst thou beheld--"}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray now, no more: my mother,"}
{"text": "Who has a charter to extol her blood,"}
{"text": "When she does praise me grieves me. I have done"}
{"text": "As you have done; that's what I can; induced"}
{"text": "As you have been; that's for my country:"}
{"text": "He that has but effected his good will"}
{"text": "Hath overta'en mine act."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "You shall not be"}
{"text": "The grave of your deserving; Rome must know"}
{"text": "The value of her own: 'twere a concealment"}
{"text": "Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,"}
{"text": "To hide your doings; and to silence that,"}
{"text": "Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,"}
{"text": "Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you"}
{"text": "In sign of what you are, not to reward"}
{"text": "What you have done--before our army hear me."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I have some wounds upon me, and they smart"}
{"text": "To hear themselves remember'd."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Should they not,"}
{"text": "Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,"}
{"text": "And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,"}
{"text": "Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all"}
{"text": "The treasure in this field achieved and city,"}
{"text": "We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,"}
{"text": "Before the common distribution, at"}
{"text": "Your only choice."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "I thank you, general;"}
{"text": "But cannot make my heart consent to take"}
{"text": "A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;"}
{"text": "And stand upon my common part with those"}
{"text": "That have beheld the doing."}
{"text": "MARCIUS:"}
{"text": "May these same instruments, which you profane,"}
{"text": "Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall"}
{"text": "I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be"}
{"text": "Made all of false-faced soothing!"}
{"text": "When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,"}
{"text": "Let him be made a coverture for the wars!"}
{"text": "No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd"}
{"text": "My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--"}
{"text": "Which, without note, here's many else have done,--"}
{"text": "You shout me forth"}
{"text": "In acclamations hyperbolical;"}
{"text": "As if I loved my little should be dieted"}
{"text": "In praises sauced with lies."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Too modest are you;"}
{"text": "More cruel to your good report than grateful"}
{"text": "To us that give you truly: by your patience,"}
{"text": "If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,"}
{"text": "Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,"}
{"text": "Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,"}
{"text": "As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius"}
{"text": "Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,"}
{"text": "My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,"}
{"text": "With all his trim belonging; and from this time,"}
{"text": "For what he did before Corioli, call him,"}
{"text": "With all the applause and clamour of the host,"}
{"text": "CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear"}
{"text": "The addition nobly ever!"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Caius Marcius Coriolanus!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I will go wash;"}
{"text": "And when my face is fair, you shall perceive"}
{"text": "Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you."}
{"text": "I mean to stride your steed, and at all times"}
{"text": "To undercrest your good addition"}
{"text": "To the fairness of my power."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "So, to our tent;"}
{"text": "Where, ere we do repose us, we will write"}
{"text": "To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,"}
{"text": "Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome"}
{"text": "The best, with whom we may articulate,"}
{"text": "For their own good and ours."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "I shall, my lord."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "The gods begin to mock me. I, that now"}
{"text": "Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg"}
{"text": "Of my lord general."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I sometime lay here in Corioli"}
{"text": "At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:"}
{"text": "He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;"}
{"text": "But then Aufidius was within my view,"}
{"text": "And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you"}
{"text": "To give my poor host freedom."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "O, well begg'd!"}
{"text": "Were he the butcher of my son, he should"}
{"text": "Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus."}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "Marcius, his name?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "By Jupiter! forgot."}
{"text": "I am weary; yea, my memory is tired."}
{"text": "Have we no wine here?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Go we to our tent:"}
{"text": "The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time"}
{"text": "It should be look'd to: come."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "The town is ta'en!"}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Condition!"}
{"text": "I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,"}
{"text": "Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!"}
{"text": "What good condition can a treaty find"}
{"text": "I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,"}
{"text": "I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,"}
{"text": "And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter"}
{"text": "As often as we eat. By the elements,"}
{"text": "If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,"}
{"text": "He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation"}
{"text": "Hath not that honour in't it had; for where"}
{"text": "I thought to crush him in an equal force,"}
{"text": "True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way"}
{"text": "Or wrath or craft may get him."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "He's the devil."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd"}
{"text": "With only suffering stain by him; for him"}
{"text": "Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,"}
{"text": "Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,"}
{"text": "The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,"}
{"text": "Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up"}
{"text": "Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst"}
{"text": "My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it"}
{"text": "At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,"}
{"text": "Against the hospitable canon, would I"}
{"text": "Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;"}
{"text": "Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must"}
{"text": "Be hostages for Rome."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "Will not you go?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--"}
{"text": "'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither"}
{"text": "How the world goes, that to the pace of it"}
{"text": "I may spur on my journey."}
{"text": "First Soldier:"}
{"text": "I shall, sir."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Good or bad?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Not according to the prayer of the people, for they"}
{"text": "love not Marcius."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Nature teaches beasts to know their friends."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray you, who does the wolf love?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "The lamb."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the"}
{"text": "noble Marcius."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two"}
{"text": "are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you."}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "Well, sir."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two"}
{"text": "have not in abundance?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Especially in pride."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "And topping all others in boasting."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "This is strange now: do you two know how you are"}
{"text": "censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the"}
{"text": "right-hand file? do you?"}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "Why, how are we censured?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?"}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "Well, well, sir, well."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of"}
{"text": "occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:"}
{"text": "give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at"}
{"text": "your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a"}
{"text": "pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for"}
{"text": "being proud?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "We do it not alone, sir."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I know you can do very little alone; for your helps"}
{"text": "are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous"}
{"text": "single: your abilities are too infant-like for"}
{"text": "doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you"}
{"text": "could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,"}
{"text": "and make but an interior survey of your good selves!"}
{"text": "O that you could!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "What then, sir?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,"}
{"text": "proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as"}
{"text": "any in Rome."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Menenius, you are known well enough too."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that"}
{"text": "loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying"}
{"text": "Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in"}
{"text": "favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like"}
{"text": "upon too trivial motion; one that converses more"}
{"text": "with the buttock of the night than with the forehead"}
{"text": "of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my"}
{"text": "malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as"}
{"text": "you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink"}
{"text": "you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a"}
{"text": "crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have"}
{"text": "delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in"}
{"text": "compound with the major part of your syllables: and"}
{"text": "though I must be content to bear with those that say"}
{"text": "you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that"}
{"text": "tell you you have good faces. If you see this in"}
{"text": "the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known"}
{"text": "well enough too? what barm can your bisson"}
{"text": "conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be"}
{"text": "known well enough too?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Come, sir, come, we know you well enough."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You"}
{"text": "are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you"}
{"text": "wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a"}
{"text": "cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;"}
{"text": "and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a"}
{"text": "second day of audience. When you are hearing a"}
{"text": "matter between party and party, if you chance to be"}
{"text": "pinched with the colic, you make faces like"}
{"text": "mummers; set up the bloody flag against all"}
{"text": "patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,"}
{"text": "dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled"}
{"text": "by your hearing: all the peace you make in their"}
{"text": "cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are"}
{"text": "a pair of strange ones."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Come, come, you are well understood to be a"}
{"text": "perfecter giber for the table than a necessary"}
{"text": "bencher in the Capitol."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall"}
{"text": "encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When"}
{"text": "you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the"}
{"text": "wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not"}
{"text": "so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's"}
{"text": "cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-"}
{"text": "saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;"}
{"text": "who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors"}
{"text": "since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the"}
{"text": "best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to"}
{"text": "your worships: more of your conversation would"}
{"text": "infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly"}
{"text": "plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you."}
{"text": "How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,"}
{"text": "were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow"}
{"text": "your eyes so fast?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for"}
{"text": "the love of Juno, let's go."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Ha! Marcius coming home!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous"}
{"text": "approbation."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!"}
{"text": "Marcius coming home!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Nay,'tis true."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath"}
{"text": "another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one"}
{"text": "at home for you."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for"}
{"text": "me!"}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven"}
{"text": "years' health; in which time I will make a lip at"}
{"text": "the physician: the most sovereign prescription in"}
{"text": "Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,"}
{"text": "of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he"}
{"text": "not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "O, no, no, no."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'"}
{"text": "victory in his pocket? the wounds become him."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home"}
{"text": "with the oaken garland."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but"}
{"text": "Aufidius got off."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:"}
{"text": "an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so"}
{"text": "fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold"}
{"text": "that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate"}
{"text": "has letters from the general, wherein he gives my"}
{"text": "son the whole name of the war: he hath in this"}
{"text": "action outdone his former deeds doubly"}
{"text": "VALERIA:"}
{"text": "In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his"}
{"text": "true purchasing."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "The gods grant them true!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "True! pow, wow."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "True! I'll be sworn they are true."}
{"text": "Where is he wounded?"}
{"text": "God save your good worships! Marcius is coming"}
{"text": "home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be"}
{"text": "large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall"}
{"text": "stand for his place. He received in the repulse of"}
{"text": "Tarquin seven hurts i' the body."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's"}
{"text": "nine that I know."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five"}
{"text": "wounds upon him."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave."}
{"text": "Hark! the trumpets."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he"}
{"text": "carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:"}
{"text": "Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;"}
{"text": "Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die."}
{"text": "Herald:"}
{"text": "Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight"}
{"text": "Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,"}
{"text": "With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these"}
{"text": "In honour follows Coriolanus."}
{"text": "Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No more of this; it does offend my heart:"}
{"text": "Pray now, no more."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Look, sir, your mother!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "O,"}
{"text": "You have, I know, petition'd all the gods"}
{"text": "For my prosperity!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Nay, my good soldier, up;"}
{"text": "My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and"}
{"text": "By deed-achieving honour newly named,--"}
{"text": "What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--"}
{"text": "But O, thy wife!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "My gracious silence, hail!"}
{"text": "Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,"}
{"text": "That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,"}
{"text": "Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,"}
{"text": "And mothers that lack sons."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Now, the gods crown thee!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "And live you yet?"}
{"text": "O my sweet lady, pardon."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:"}
{"text": "And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep"}
{"text": "And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome."}
{"text": "A curse begin at very root on's heart,"}
{"text": "That is not glad to see thee! You are three"}
{"text": "That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,"}
{"text": "We have some old crab-trees here"}
{"text": "at home that will not"}
{"text": "Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:"}
{"text": "We call a nettle but a nettle and"}
{"text": "The faults of fools but folly."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Ever right."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Menenius ever, ever."}
{"text": "Herald:"}
{"text": "Give way there, and go on!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I have lived"}
{"text": "To see inherited my very wishes"}
{"text": "And the buildings of my fancy: only"}
{"text": "There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but"}
{"text": "Our Rome will cast upon thee."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Know, good mother,"}
{"text": "I had rather be their servant in my way,"}
{"text": "Than sway with them in theirs."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "On, to the Capitol!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights"}
{"text": "Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse"}
{"text": "Into a rapture lets her baby cry"}
{"text": "While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins"}
{"text": "Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,"}
{"text": "Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,"}
{"text": "Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed"}
{"text": "With variable complexions, all agreeing"}
{"text": "In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens"}
{"text": "Do press among the popular throngs and puff"}
{"text": "To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames"}
{"text": "Commit the war of white and damask in"}
{"text": "Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil"}
{"text": "Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother"}
{"text": "As if that whatsoever god who leads him"}
{"text": "Were slily crept into his human powers"}
{"text": "And gave him graceful posture."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "On the sudden,"}
{"text": "I warrant him consul."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Then our office may,"}
{"text": "During his power, go sleep."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "He cannot temperately transport his honours"}
{"text": "From where he should begin and end, but will"}
{"text": "Lose those he hath won."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "In that there's comfort."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Doubt not"}
{"text": "The commoners, for whom we stand, but they"}
{"text": "Upon their ancient malice will forget"}
{"text": "With the least cause these his new honours, which"}
{"text": "That he will give them make I as little question"}
{"text": "As he is proud to do't."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "I heard him swear,"}
{"text": "Were he to stand for consul, never would he"}
{"text": "Appear i' the market-place nor on him put"}
{"text": "The napless vesture of humility;"}
{"text": "Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds"}
{"text": "To the people, beg their stinking breaths."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis right."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "It was his word: O, he would miss it rather"}
{"text": "Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,"}
{"text": "And the desire of the nobles."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "I wish no better"}
{"text": "Than have him hold that purpose and to put it"}
{"text": "In execution."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis most like he will."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "It shall be to him then as our good wills,"}
{"text": "A sure destruction."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "So it must fall out"}
{"text": "To him or our authorities. For an end,"}
{"text": "We must suggest the people in what hatred"}
{"text": "He still hath held them; that to's power he would"}
{"text": "Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and"}
{"text": "Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,"}
{"text": "In human action and capacity,"}
{"text": "Of no more soul nor fitness for the world"}
{"text": "Than camels in the war, who have their provand"}
{"text": "Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows"}
{"text": "For sinking under them."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This, as you say, suggested"}
{"text": "At some time when his soaring insolence"}
{"text": "Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,"}
{"text": "If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy"}
{"text": "As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire"}
{"text": "To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze"}
{"text": "Shall darken him for ever."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "What's the matter?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought"}
{"text": "That Marcius shall be consul:"}
{"text": "I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and"}
{"text": "The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,"}
{"text": "Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,"}
{"text": "Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,"}
{"text": "As to Jove's statue, and the commons made"}
{"text": "A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:"}
{"text": "I never saw the like."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Let's to the Capitol;"}
{"text": "And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,"}
{"text": "But hearts for the event."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Have with you."}
{"text": "First Officer:"}
{"text": "Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand"}
{"text": "for consulships?"}
{"text": "Second Officer:"}
{"text": "Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one"}
{"text": "Coriolanus will carry it."}
{"text": "First Officer:"}
{"text": "That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and"}
{"text": "loves not the common people."}
{"text": "Second Officer:"}
{"text": "Faith, there had been many great men that have"}
{"text": "flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there"}
{"text": "be many that they have loved, they know not"}
{"text": "wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,"}
{"text": "they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for"}
{"text": "Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate"}
{"text": "him manifests the true knowledge he has in their"}
{"text": "disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets"}
{"text": "them plainly see't."}
{"text": "First Officer:"}
{"text": "If he did not care whether he had their love or no,"}
{"text": "he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither"}
{"text": "good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater"}
{"text": "devotion than can render it him; and leaves"}
{"text": "nothing undone that may fully discover him their"}
{"text": "opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and"}
{"text": "displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he"}
{"text": "dislikes, to flatter them for their love."}
{"text": "Second Officer:"}
{"text": "He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his"}
{"text": "ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,"}
{"text": "having been supple and courteous to the people,"}
{"text": "bonneted, without any further deed to have them at"}
{"text": "an into their estimation and report: but he hath so"}
{"text": "planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions"}
{"text": "in their hearts, that for their tongues to be"}
{"text": "silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of"}
{"text": "ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a"}
{"text": "malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck"}
{"text": "reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it."}
{"text": "First Officer:"}
{"text": "No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they"}
{"text": "are coming."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Having determined of the Volsces and"}
{"text": "To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,"}
{"text": "As the main point of this our after-meeting,"}
{"text": "To gratify his noble service that"}
{"text": "Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,"}
{"text": "please you,"}
{"text": "Most reverend and grave elders, to desire"}
{"text": "The present consul, and last general"}
{"text": "In our well-found successes, to report"}
{"text": "A little of that worthy work perform'd"}
{"text": "By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom"}
{"text": "We met here both to thank and to remember"}
{"text": "With honours like himself."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Speak, good Cominius:"}
{"text": "Leave nothing out for length, and make us think"}
{"text": "Rather our state's defective for requital"}
{"text": "Than we to stretch it out."}
{"text": "Masters o' the people,"}
{"text": "We do request your kindest ears, and after,"}
{"text": "Your loving motion toward the common body,"}
{"text": "To yield what passes here."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We are convented"}
{"text": "Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts"}
{"text": "Inclinable to honour and advance"}
{"text": "The theme of our assembly."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Which the rather"}
{"text": "We shall be blest to do, if he remember"}
{"text": "A kinder value of the people than"}
{"text": "He hath hereto prized them at."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "That's off, that's off;"}
{"text": "I would you rather had been silent. Please you"}
{"text": "To hear Cominius speak?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Most willingly;"}
{"text": "But yet my caution was more pertinent"}
{"text": "Than the rebuke you give it."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "He loves your people"}
{"text": "But tie him not to be their bedfellow."}
{"text": "Worthy Cominius, speak."}
{"text": "Nay, keep your place."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear"}
{"text": "What you have nobly done."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Your horror's pardon:"}
{"text": "I had rather have my wounds to heal again"}
{"text": "Than hear say how I got them."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, I hope"}
{"text": "My words disbench'd you not."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No, sir: yet oft,"}
{"text": "When blows have made me stay, I fled from words."}
{"text": "You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but"}
{"text": "your people,"}
{"text": "I love them as they weigh."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray now, sit down."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun"}
{"text": "When the alarum were struck than idly sit"}
{"text": "To hear my nothings monster'd."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Masters of the people,"}
{"text": "Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--"}
{"text": "That's thousand to one good one--when you now see"}
{"text": "He had rather venture all his limbs for honour"}
{"text": "Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus"}
{"text": "Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held"}
{"text": "That valour is the chiefest virtue, and"}
{"text": "Most dignifies the haver: if it be,"}
{"text": "The man I speak of cannot in the world"}
{"text": "Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,"}
{"text": "When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought"}
{"text": "Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,"}
{"text": "Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,"}
{"text": "When with his Amazonian chin he drove"}
{"text": "The bristled lips before him: be bestrid"}
{"text": "An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view"}
{"text": "Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,"}
{"text": "And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,"}
{"text": "When he might act the woman in the scene,"}
{"text": "He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed"}
{"text": "Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age"}
{"text": "Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,"}
{"text": "And in the brunt of seventeen battles since"}
{"text": "He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,"}
{"text": "Before and in Corioli, let me say,"}
{"text": "I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;"}
{"text": "And by his rare example made the coward"}
{"text": "Turn terror into sport: as weeds before"}
{"text": "A vessel under sail, so men obey'd"}
{"text": "And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,"}
{"text": "Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot"}
{"text": "He was a thing of blood, whose every motion"}
{"text": "Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd"}
{"text": "The mortal gate of the city, which he painted"}
{"text": "With shunless destiny; aidless came off,"}
{"text": "And with a sudden reinforcement struck"}
{"text": "Corioli like a planet: now all's his:"}
{"text": "When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce"}
{"text": "His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit"}
{"text": "Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,"}
{"text": "And to the battle came he; where he did"}
{"text": "Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if"}
{"text": "'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd"}
{"text": "Both field and city ours, he never stood"}
{"text": "To ease his breast with panting."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Worthy man!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "He cannot but with measure fit the honours"}
{"text": "Which we devise him."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Our spoils he kick'd at,"}
{"text": "And look'd upon things precious as they were"}
{"text": "The common muck of the world: he covets less"}
{"text": "Than misery itself would give; rewards"}
{"text": "His deeds with doing them, and is content"}
{"text": "To spend the time to end it."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "He's right noble:"}
{"text": "Let him be call'd for."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Call Coriolanus."}
{"text": "Officer:"}
{"text": "He doth appear."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased"}
{"text": "To make thee consul."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I do owe them still"}
{"text": "My life and services."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "It then remains"}
{"text": "That you do speak to the people."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I do beseech you,"}
{"text": "Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot"}
{"text": "Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,"}
{"text": "For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you"}
{"text": "That I may pass this doing."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, the people"}
{"text": "Must have their voices; neither will they bate"}
{"text": "One jot of ceremony."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Put them not to't:"}
{"text": "Pray you, go fit you to the custom and"}
{"text": "Take to you, as your predecessors have,"}
{"text": "Your honour with your form."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "It is apart"}
{"text": "That I shall blush in acting, and might well"}
{"text": "Be taken from the people."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Mark you that?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;"}
{"text": "Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,"}
{"text": "As if I had received them for the hire"}
{"text": "Of their breath only!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Do not stand upon't."}
{"text": "We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,"}
{"text": "Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul"}
{"text": "Wish we all joy and honour."}
{"text": "Senators:"}
{"text": "To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "You see how he intends to use the people."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "May they perceive's intent! He will require them,"}
{"text": "As if he did contemn what he requested"}
{"text": "Should be in them to give."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Come, we'll inform them"}
{"text": "Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,"}
{"text": "I know, they do attend us."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "We may, sir, if we will."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a"}
{"text": "power that we have no power to do; for if he show us"}
{"text": "his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our"}
{"text": "tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if"}
{"text": "he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him"}
{"text": "our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is"}
{"text": "monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,"}
{"text": "were to make a monster of the multitude: of the"}
{"text": "which we being members, should bring ourselves to be"}
{"text": "monstrous members."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "And to make us no better thought of, a little help"}
{"text": "will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he"}
{"text": "himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "We have been called so of many; not that our heads"}
{"text": "are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,"}
{"text": "but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and"}
{"text": "truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of"}
{"text": "one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,"}
{"text": "and their consent of one direct way should be at"}
{"text": "once to all the points o' the compass."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would"}
{"text": "fly?"}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's"}
{"text": "will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but"}
{"text": "if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Why that way?"}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts"}
{"text": "melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return"}
{"text": "for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "You are never without your tricks: you may, you may."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Are you all resolved to give your voices? But"}
{"text": "that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I"}
{"text": "say, if he would incline to the people, there was"}
{"text": "never a worthier man."}
{"text": "Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his"}
{"text": "behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to"}
{"text": "come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and"}
{"text": "by threes. He's to make his requests by"}
{"text": "particulars; wherein every one of us has a single"}
{"text": "honour, in giving him our own voices with our own"}
{"text": "tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how"}
{"text": "you shall go by him."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Content, content."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "O sir, you are not right: have you not known"}
{"text": "The worthiest men have done't?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What must I say?"}
{"text": "'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring"}
{"text": "My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!"}
{"text": "I got them in my country's service, when"}
{"text": "Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran"}
{"text": "From the noise of our own drums.'"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "O me, the gods!"}
{"text": "You must not speak of that: you must desire them"}
{"text": "To think upon you."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Think upon me! hang 'em!"}
{"text": "I would they would forget me, like the virtues"}
{"text": "Which our divines lose by 'em."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You'll mar all:"}
{"text": "I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,"}
{"text": "In wholesome manner."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Bid them wash their faces"}
{"text": "And keep their teeth clean."}
{"text": "So, here comes a brace."}
{"text": "You know the cause, air, of my standing here."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Mine own desert."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Your own desert!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, but not mine own desire."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "How not your own desire?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the"}
{"text": "poor with begging."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to"}
{"text": "gain by you."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "The price is to ask it kindly."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to"}
{"text": "show you, which shall be yours in private. Your"}
{"text": "good voice, sir; what say you?"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "You shall ha' it, worthy sir."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices"}
{"text": "begged. I have your alms: adieu."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "But this is something odd."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your"}
{"text": "voices that I may be consul, I have here the"}
{"text": "customary gown."}
{"text": "Fourth Citizen:"}
{"text": "You have deserved nobly of your country, and you"}
{"text": "have not deserved nobly."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Your enigma?"}
{"text": "Fourth Citizen:"}
{"text": "You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have"}
{"text": "been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved"}
{"text": "the common people."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "You should account me the more virtuous that I have"}
{"text": "not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my"}
{"text": "sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer"}
{"text": "estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account"}
{"text": "gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is"}
{"text": "rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise"}
{"text": "the insinuating nod and be off to them most"}
{"text": "counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the"}
{"text": "bewitchment of some popular man and give it"}
{"text": "bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,"}
{"text": "I may be consul."}
{"text": "Fifth Citizen:"}
{"text": "We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give"}
{"text": "you our voices heartily."}
{"text": "Fourth Citizen:"}
{"text": "You have received many wounds for your country."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I"}
{"text": "will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further."}
{"text": "Both Citizens:"}
{"text": "The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Most sweet voices!"}
{"text": "Better it is to die, better to starve,"}
{"text": "Than crave the hire which first we do deserve."}
{"text": "Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,"}
{"text": "To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,"}
{"text": "Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:"}
{"text": "What custom wills, in all things should we do't,"}
{"text": "The dust on antique time would lie unswept,"}
{"text": "And mountainous error be too highly heapt"}
{"text": "For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,"}
{"text": "Let the high office and the honour go"}
{"text": "To one that would do thus. I am half through;"}
{"text": "The one part suffer'd, the other will I do."}
{"text": "Here come more voices."}
{"text": "Your voices: for your voices I have fought;"}
{"text": "Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear"}
{"text": "Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six"}
{"text": "I have seen and heard of; for your voices have"}
{"text": "Done many things, some less, some more your voices:"}
{"text": "Indeed I would be consul."}
{"text": "Sixth Citizen:"}
{"text": "He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest"}
{"text": "man's voice."}
{"text": "Seventh Citizen:"}
{"text": "Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,"}
{"text": "and make him good friend to the people!"}
{"text": "All Citizens:"}
{"text": "Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Worthy voices!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes"}
{"text": "Endue you with the people's voice: remains"}
{"text": "That, in the official marks invested, you"}
{"text": "Anon do meet the senate."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Is this done?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "The custom of request you have discharged:"}
{"text": "The people do admit you, and are summon'd"}
{"text": "To meet anon, upon your approbation."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Where? at the senate-house?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "There, Coriolanus."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "May I change these garments?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "You may, sir."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,"}
{"text": "Repair to the senate-house."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll keep you company. Will you along?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "We stay here for the people."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Fare you well."}
{"text": "He has it now, and by his looks methink"}
{"text": "'Tis warm at 's heart."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds."}
{"text": "will you dismiss the people?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "How now, my masters! have you chose this man?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "He has our voices, sir."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "We pray the gods he may deserve your loves."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,"}
{"text": "He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Certainly"}
{"text": "He flouted us downright."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says"}
{"text": "He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us"}
{"text": "His marks of merit, wounds received for's country."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, so he did, I am sure."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "No, no; no man saw 'em."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "He said he had wounds, which he could show"}
{"text": "in private;"}
{"text": "And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,"}
{"text": "'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,"}
{"text": "But by your voices, will not so permit me;"}
{"text": "Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,"}
{"text": "Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:"}
{"text": "Your most sweet voices: now you have left"}
{"text": "your voices,"}
{"text": "I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Why either were you ignorant to see't,"}
{"text": "Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness"}
{"text": "To yield your voices?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Could you not have told him"}
{"text": "As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,"}
{"text": "But was a petty servant to the state,"}
{"text": "He was your enemy, ever spake against"}
{"text": "Your liberties and the charters that you bear"}
{"text": "I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving"}
{"text": "A place of potency and sway o' the state,"}
{"text": "If he should still malignantly remain"}
{"text": "Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might"}
{"text": "Be curses to yourselves? You should have said"}
{"text": "That as his worthy deeds did claim no less"}
{"text": "Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature"}
{"text": "Would think upon you for your voices and"}
{"text": "Translate his malice towards you into love,"}
{"text": "Standing your friendly lord."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Thus to have said,"}
{"text": "As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit"}
{"text": "And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd"}
{"text": "Either his gracious promise, which you might,"}
{"text": "As cause had call'd you up, have held him to"}
{"text": "Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,"}
{"text": "Which easily endures not article"}
{"text": "Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,"}
{"text": "You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler"}
{"text": "And pass'd him unelected."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Did you perceive"}
{"text": "He did solicit you in free contempt"}
{"text": "When he did need your loves, and do you think"}
{"text": "That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,"}
{"text": "When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies"}
{"text": "No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry"}
{"text": "Against the rectorship of judgment?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Have you"}
{"text": "Ere now denied the asker? and now again"}
{"text": "Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow"}
{"text": "Your sued-for tongues?"}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "And will deny him:"}
{"text": "I'll have five hundred voices of that sound."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,"}
{"text": "They have chose a consul that will from them take"}
{"text": "Their liberties; make them of no more voice"}
{"text": "Than dogs that are as often beat for barking"}
{"text": "As therefore kept to do so."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Let them assemble,"}
{"text": "And on a safer judgment all revoke"}
{"text": "Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,"}
{"text": "And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not"}
{"text": "With what contempt he wore the humble weed,"}
{"text": "How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,"}
{"text": "Thinking upon his services, took from you"}
{"text": "The apprehension of his present portance,"}
{"text": "Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion"}
{"text": "After the inveterate hate he bears you."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Lay"}
{"text": "A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,"}
{"text": "No impediment between, but that you must"}
{"text": "Cast your election on him."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Say, you chose him"}
{"text": "More after our commandment than as guided"}
{"text": "By your own true affections, and that your minds,"}
{"text": "Preoccupied with what you rather must do"}
{"text": "Than what you should, made you against the grain"}
{"text": "To voice him consul: lay the fault on us."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you."}
{"text": "How youngly he began to serve his country,"}
{"text": "How long continued, and what stock he springs of,"}
{"text": "The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came"}
{"text": "That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,"}
{"text": "Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;"}
{"text": "Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,"}
{"text": "That our beat water brought by conduits hither;"}
{"text": "And"}
{"text": "Twice being"}
{"text": "Was his great ancestor."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "One thus descended,"}
{"text": "That hath beside well in his person wrought"}
{"text": "To be set high in place, we did commend"}
{"text": "To your remembrances: but you have found,"}
{"text": "Scaling his present bearing with his past,"}
{"text": "That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke"}
{"text": "Your sudden approbation."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Say, you ne'er had done't--"}
{"text": "Harp on that still--but by our putting on;"}
{"text": "And presently, when you have drawn your number,"}
{"text": "Repair to the Capitol."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "We will so: almost all"}
{"text": "Repent in their election."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Let them go on;"}
{"text": "This mutiny were better put in hazard,"}
{"text": "Than stay, past doubt, for greater:"}
{"text": "If, as his nature is, he fall in rage"}
{"text": "With their refusal, both observe and answer"}
{"text": "The vantage of his anger."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "To the Capitol, come:"}
{"text": "We will be there before the stream o' the people;"}
{"text": "And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,"}
{"text": "Which we have goaded onward."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "He had, my lord; and that it was which caused"}
{"text": "Our swifter composition."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "So then the Volsces stand but as at first,"}
{"text": "Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road."}
{"text": "Upon's again."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "They are worn, lord consul, so,"}
{"text": "That we shall hardly in our ages see"}
{"text": "Their banners wave again."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Saw you Aufidius?"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse"}
{"text": "Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely"}
{"text": "Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Spoke he of me?"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "He did, my lord."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "How? what?"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "How often he had met you, sword to sword;"}
{"text": "That of all things upon the earth he hated"}
{"text": "Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes"}
{"text": "To hopeless restitution, so he might"}
{"text": "Be call'd your vanquisher."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "At Antium lives he?"}
{"text": "LARTIUS:"}
{"text": "At Antium."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I wish I had a cause to seek him there,"}
{"text": "To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home."}
{"text": "Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,"}
{"text": "The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;"}
{"text": "For they do prank them in authority,"}
{"text": "Against all noble sufferance."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Pass no further."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ha! what is that?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "It will be dangerous to go on: no further."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What makes this change?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The matter?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Cominius, no."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Have I had children's voices?"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "The people are incensed against him."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Stop,"}
{"text": "Or all will fall in broil."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Are these your herd?"}
{"text": "Must these have voices, that can yield them now"}
{"text": "And straight disclaim their tongues? What are"}
{"text": "your offices?"}
{"text": "You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?"}
{"text": "Have you not set them on?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Be calm, be calm."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,"}
{"text": "To curb the will of the nobility:"}
{"text": "Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule"}
{"text": "Nor ever will be ruled."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Call't not a plot:"}
{"text": "The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,"}
{"text": "When corn was given them gratis, you repined;"}
{"text": "Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them"}
{"text": "Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Why, this was known before."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Not to them all."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Have you inform'd them sithence?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "How! I inform them!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "You are like to do such business."}

{"text": "Your fellow tribune."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "You show too much of that"}
{"text": "For which the people stir: if you will pass"}
{"text": "To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,"}
{"text": "Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,"}
{"text": "Or never be so noble as a consul,"}

{"text": "MENENIUS:"}

{"text": "The people are abused; set on. This paltering"}
{"text": "Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus"}

{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}

{"text": "Not now, not now."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Not in this heat, sir, now."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,"}
{"text": "I crave their pardons:"}
{"text": "For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them"}
{"text": "Regard me as I do not flatter, and"}
{"text": "Therein behold themselves: I say again,"}
{"text": "In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate"}
{"text": "The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,"}
{"text": "Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,"}
{"text": "and scatter'd,"}
{"text": "By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,"}
{"text": "Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that"}
{"text": "Which they have given to beggars."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}

{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "No more words, we beseech you."}

{"text": "Coin words till their decay against those measles,"}
{"text": "Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought"}
{"text": "The very way to catch them."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "You speak o' the people,"}

{"text": "His absolute 'shall'?"}

{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "'Shall'!"}
{"text": "O good but most unwise patricians! why,"}
{"text": "You grave but reckless senators, have you thus"}
{"text": "Given Hydra here to choose an officer,"}
{"text": "That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but"}
{"text": "The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit"}
{"text": "To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,"}
{"text": "And make your channel his? If he have power"}

{"text": "Be not as common fools; if you are not,"}
{"text": "Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,"}
{"text": "If they be senators: and they are no less,"}
{"text": "When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste"}
{"text": "Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,"}
{"text": "And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'"}
{"text": "His popular 'shall' against a graver bench"}
{"text": "Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!"}
{"text": "It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches"}

{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth"}
{"text": "The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used"}
{"text": "Sometime in Greece,--"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Well, well, no more of that."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Though there the people had more absolute power,"}
{"text": "I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed"}
{"text": "The ruin of the state."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Why, shall the people give"}
{"text": "One that speaks thus their voice?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I'll give my reasons,"}
{"text": "More worthier than their voices. They know the corn"}
{"text": "Was not our recompense, resting well assured"}
{"text": "That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,"}
{"text": "Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,"}
{"text": "They would not thread the gates. This kind of service"}
{"text": "Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war"}
{"text": "Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd"}
{"text": "Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation"}
{"text": "Which they have often made against the senate,"}
{"text": "All cause unborn, could never be the motive"}
{"text": "Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?"}
{"text": "How shall this bisson multitude digest"}
{"text": "The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express"}
{"text": "What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;"}
{"text": "We are the greater poll, and in true fear"}
{"text": "They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase"}
{"text": "The nature of our seats and make the rabble"}
{"text": "Call our cares fears; which will in time"}
{"text": "Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in"}
{"text": "The crows to peck the eagles."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, enough."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Enough, with over-measure."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No, take more:"}
{"text": "What may be sworn by, both divine and human,"}
{"text": "Seal what I end withal! This double worship,"}
{"text": "Where one part does disdain with cause, the other"}
{"text": "Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,"}
{"text": "Cannot conclude but by the yea and no"}
{"text": "Of general ignorance,--it must omit"}
{"text": "Real necessities, and give way the while"}
{"text": "To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,"}
{"text": "it follows,"}
{"text": "Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--"}
{"text": "You that will be less fearful than discreet,"}
{"text": "That love the fundamental part of state"}
{"text": "More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer"}
{"text": "A noble life before a long, and wish"}
{"text": "To jump a body with a dangerous physic"}
{"text": "That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out"}
{"text": "The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick"}
{"text": "The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour"}
{"text": "Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state"}

{"text": "On whom depending, their obedience fails"}
{"text": "To the greater bench: in a rebellion,"}
{"text": "When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,"}
{"text": "Then were they chosen: in a better hour,"}
{"text": "Let what is meet be said it must be meet,"}
{"text": "And throw their power i' the dust."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Manifest treason!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This a consul? no."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "The aediles, ho!"}
{"text": "Let him be apprehended."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Go, call the people:"}
{"text": "in whose name myself"}

{"text": "A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,"}

{"text": "Hence, old goat!"}
{"text": "Senators, &C:"}
{"text": "We'll surety him."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Aged sir, hands off."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}

{"text": "'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What is about to be? I am out of breath;"}
{"text": "Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes"}
{"text": "To the people! Coriolanus, patience!"}
{"text": "Speak, good Sicinius."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Hear me, people; peace!"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "You are at point to lose your liberties:"}
{"text": "Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,"}
{"text": "Whom late you have named for consul."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Fie, fie, fie!"}
{"text": "This is the way to kindle, not to quench."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "To unbuild the city and to lay all flat."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "What is the city but the people?"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "True,"}
{"text": "The people are the city."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "By the consent of all, we were establish'd"}
{"text": "The people's magistrates."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "You so remain."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "And so are like to do."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "That is the way to lay the city flat;"}
{"text": "To bring the roof to the foundation,"}
{"text": "And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,"}
{"text": "In heaps and piles of ruin."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This deserves death."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Or let us stand to our authority,"}
{"text": "Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,"}
{"text": "Upon the part o' the people, in whose power"}
{"text": "We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy"}
{"text": "Of present death."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Therefore lay hold of him;"}
{"text": "Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence"}
{"text": "Into destruction cast him."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "AEdiles, seize him!"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Yield, Marcius, yield!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Hear me one word;"}
{"text": "Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "Peace, peace!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, those cold ways,"}
{"text": "That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous"}
{"text": "Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,"}
{"text": "And bear him to the rock."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No, I'll die here."}
{"text": "There's some among you have beheld me fighting:"}
{"text": "Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Lay hands upon him."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Help Marcius, help,"}
{"text": "You that be noble; help him, young and old!"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Down with him, down with him!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!"}
{"text": "All will be naught else."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Get you gone."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Stand fast;"}
{"text": "We have as many friends as enemies."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Sham it be put to that?"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "The gods forbid!"}
{"text": "I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;"}
{"text": "Leave us to cure this cause."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "For 'tis a sore upon us,"}
{"text": "You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, sir, along with us."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I would they were barbarians--as they are,"}
{"text": "Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,"}
{"text": "Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Be gone;"}
{"text": "Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;"}
{"text": "One time will owe another."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "On fair ground"}
{"text": "I could beat forty of them."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I could myself"}
{"text": "Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the"}
{"text": "two tribunes:"}
{"text": "But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;"}
{"text": "And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands"}
{"text": "Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,"}
{"text": "Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend"}
{"text": "Like interrupted waters and o'erbear"}
{"text": "What they are used to bear."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray you, be gone:"}
{"text": "I'll try whether my old wit be in request"}
{"text": "With those that have but little: this must be patch'd"}
{"text": "With cloth of any colour."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, come away."}
{"text": "A Patrician:"}
{"text": "This man has marr'd his fortune."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "His nature is too noble for the world:"}
{"text": "He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,"}
{"text": "Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:"}
{"text": "What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;"}
{"text": "And, being angry, does forget that ever"}
{"text": "He heard the name of death."}
{"text": "Here's goodly work!"}
{"text": "Second Patrician:"}
{"text": "I would they were abed!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!"}
{"text": "Could he not speak 'em fair?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Where is this viper"}
{"text": "That would depopulate the city and"}
{"text": "Be every man himself?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You worthy tribunes,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock"}
{"text": "With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,"}
{"text": "And therefore law shall scorn him further trial"}
{"text": "Than the severity of the public power"}
{"text": "Which he so sets at nought."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "He shall well know"}
{"text": "The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,"}
{"text": "And we their hands."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "He shall, sure on't."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, sir,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Peace!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt"}
{"text": "With modest warrant."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, how comes't that you"}
{"text": "Have holp to make this rescue?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Hear me speak:"}
{"text": "As I do know the consul's worthiness,"}
{"text": "So can I name his faults,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Consul! what consul?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The consul Coriolanus."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "He consul!"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "No, no, no, no, no."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,"}
{"text": "I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;"}
{"text": "The which shall turn you to no further harm"}
{"text": "Than so much loss of time."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Speak briefly then;"}
{"text": "For we are peremptory to dispatch"}
{"text": "This viperous traitor: to eject him hence"}
{"text": "Were but one danger, and to keep him here"}
{"text": "Our certain death: therefore it is decreed"}
{"text": "He dies to-night."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Now the good gods forbid"}
{"text": "That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude"}
{"text": "Towards her deserved children is enroll'd"}
{"text": "In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam"}
{"text": "Should now eat up her own!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "He's a disease that must be cut away."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "O, he's a limb that has but a disease;"}
{"text": "Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy."}
{"text": "What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?"}
{"text": "Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--"}
{"text": "Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,"}
{"text": "By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;"}
{"text": "And what is left, to lose it by his country,"}
{"text": "Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,"}
{"text": "A brand to the end o' the world."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This is clean kam."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Merely awry: when he did love his country,"}
{"text": "It honour'd him."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "The service of the foot"}
{"text": "Being once gangrened, is not then respected"}
{"text": "For what before it was."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "We'll hear no more."}
{"text": "Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:"}
{"text": "Lest his infection, being of catching nature,"}
{"text": "Spread further."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "One word more, one word."}
{"text": "This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find"}
{"text": "The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late"}
{"text": "Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;"}
{"text": "Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,"}
{"text": "And sack great Rome with Romans."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "If it were so,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "What do ye talk?"}
{"text": "Have we not had a taste of his obedience?"}
{"text": "Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars"}
{"text": "Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd"}
{"text": "In bolted language; meal and bran together"}
{"text": "He throws without distinction. Give me leave,"}
{"text": "I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him"}
{"text": "Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,"}
{"text": "In peace, to his utmost peril."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Noble tribunes,"}
{"text": "It is the humane way: the other course"}
{"text": "Will prove too bloody, and the end of it"}
{"text": "Unknown to the beginning."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Noble Menenius,"}
{"text": "Be you then as the people's officer."}
{"text": "Masters, lay down your weapons."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Go not home."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:"}
{"text": "Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed"}
{"text": "In our first way."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll bring him to you."}
{"text": "Let me desire your company: he must come,"}
{"text": "Or what is worst will follow."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Pray you, let's to him."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Let them puff all about mine ears, present me"}
{"text": "Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,"}
{"text": "Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,"}
{"text": "That the precipitation might down stretch"}
{"text": "Below the beam of sight, yet will I still"}
{"text": "Be thus to them."}
{"text": "A Patrician:"}
{"text": "You do the nobler."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I muse my mother"}
{"text": "Does not approve me further, who was wont"}
{"text": "To call them woollen vassals, things created"}
{"text": "To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads"}
{"text": "In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,"}
{"text": "When one but of my ordinance stood up"}
{"text": "To speak of peace or war."}
{"text": "I talk of you:"}
{"text": "Why did you wish me milder? would you have me"}
{"text": "False to my nature? Rather say I play"}
{"text": "The man I am."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "O, sir, sir, sir,"}
{"text": "I would have had you put your power well on,"}
{"text": "Before you had worn it out."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Let go."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "You might have been enough the man you are,"}
{"text": "With striving less to be so; lesser had been"}
{"text": "The thwartings of your dispositions, if"}
{"text": "You had not show'd them how ye were disposed"}
{"text": "Ere they lack'd power to cross you."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Let them hang."}
{"text": "A Patrician:"}
{"text": "Ay, and burn too."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, come, you have been too rough, something"}
{"text": "too rough;"}
{"text": "You must return and mend it."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "There's no remedy;"}
{"text": "Unless, by not so doing, our good city"}
{"text": "Cleave in the midst, and perish."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Pray, be counsell'd:"}
{"text": "I have a heart as little apt as yours,"}
{"text": "But yet a brain that leads my use of anger"}
{"text": "To better vantage."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Well said, noble woman?"}
{"text": "Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that"}
{"text": "The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic"}
{"text": "For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,"}
{"text": "Which I can scarcely bear."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What must I do?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Return to the tribunes."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Well, what then? what then?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Repent what you have spoke."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "For them! I cannot do it to the gods;"}
{"text": "Must I then do't to them?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "You are too absolute;"}
{"text": "Though therein you can never be too noble,"}
{"text": "But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,"}
{"text": "Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,"}
{"text": "I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,"}
{"text": "In peace what each of them by the other lose,"}
{"text": "That they combine not there."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Tush, tush!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "A good demand."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "If it be honour in your wars to seem"}
{"text": "The same you are not, which, for your best ends,"}
{"text": "You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,"}
{"text": "That it shall hold companionship in peace"}
{"text": "With honour, as in war, since that to both"}
{"text": "It stands in like request?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Why force you this?"}

{"text": "Because that now it lies you on to speak"}
{"text": "To the people; not by your own instruction,"}
{"text": "Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,"}
{"text": "But with such words that are but rooted in"}
{"text": "Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables"}
{"text": "Of no allowance to your bosom's truth."}
{"text": "Now, this no more dishonours you at all"}
{"text": "Than to take in a town with gentle words,"}
{"text": "Which else would put you to your fortune and"}
{"text": "The hazard of much blood."}
{"text": "I would dissemble with my nature where"}
{"text": "My fortunes and my friends at stake required"}
{"text": "I should do so in honour: I am in this,"}
{"text": "Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;"}
{"text": "And you will rather show our general louts"}
{"text": "How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,"}
{"text": "For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard"}
{"text": "Of what that want might ruin."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Noble lady!"}
{"text": "Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,"}
{"text": "Not what is dangerous present, but the loss"}
{"text": "Of what is past."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I prithee now, my son,"}
{"text": "Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;"}
{"text": "And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--"}
{"text": "Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business"}
{"text": "Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant"}
{"text": "More learned than the ears--waving thy head,"}
{"text": "Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,"}
{"text": "Now humble as the ripest mulberry"}
{"text": "That will not hold the handling: or say to them,"}
{"text": "Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils"}
{"text": "Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,"}
{"text": "Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,"}
{"text": "In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame"}
{"text": "Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far"}
{"text": "As thou hast power and person."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "This but done,"}
{"text": "Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;"}
{"text": "For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free"}
{"text": "As words to little purpose."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Prithee now,"}
{"text": "Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather"}
{"text": "Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf"}
{"text": "Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit"}
{"text": "You make strong party, or defend yourself"}
{"text": "By calmness or by absence: all's in anger."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Only fair speech."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I think 'twill serve, if he"}

{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?"}
{"text": "Must I with base tongue give my noble heart"}
{"text": "A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:"}
{"text": "Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,"}
{"text": "This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it"}
{"text": "And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!"}
{"text": "You have put me now to such a part which never"}
{"text": "I shall discharge to the life."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, come, we'll prompt you."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said"}
{"text": "My praises made thee first a soldier, so,"}
{"text": "To have my praise for this, perform a part"}
{"text": "Thou hast not done before."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Well, I must do't:"}
{"text": "Away, my disposition, and possess me"}
{"text": "Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,"}
{"text": "Which quired with my drum, into a pipe"}
{"text": "Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice"}
{"text": "That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves"}
{"text": "Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up"}
{"text": "The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue"}
{"text": "Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,"}
{"text": "Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his"}
{"text": "That hath received an alms! I will not do't,"}
{"text": "Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth"}

{"text": "A most inherent baseness."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "At thy choice, then:"}
{"text": "To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour"}
{"text": "Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let"}
{"text": "Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear"}
{"text": "Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death"}
{"text": "With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list"}
{"text": "Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,"}
{"text": "But owe thy pride thyself."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Pray, be content:"}
{"text": "Mother, I am going to the market-place;"}
{"text": "Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,"}
{"text": "Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved"}
{"text": "Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:"}
{"text": "Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;"}
{"text": "Or never trust to what my tongue can do"}
{"text": "I' the way of flattery further."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Do your will."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself"}
{"text": "To answer mildly; for they are prepared"}
{"text": "With accusations, as I hear, more strong"}
{"text": "Than are upon you yet."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:"}
{"text": "Let them accuse me by invention, I"}
{"text": "Will answer in mine honour."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, but mildly."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "In this point charge him home, that he affects"}
{"text": "Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,"}
{"text": "Enforce him with his envy to the people,"}
{"text": "And that the spoil got on the Antiates"}
{"text": "Was ne'er distributed."}
{"text": "What, will he come?"}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "He's coming."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "How accompanied?"}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "With old Menenius, and those senators"}
{"text": "That always favour'd him."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Have you a catalogue"}
{"text": "Of all the voices that we have procured"}
{"text": "Set down by the poll?"}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "I have; 'tis ready."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Have you collected them by tribes?"}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "I have."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Assemble presently the people hither;"}
{"text": "And when they bear me say 'It shall be so"}
{"text": "I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either"}
{"text": "For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them"}
{"text": "If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'"}
{"text": "Insisting on the old prerogative"}
{"text": "And power i' the truth o' the cause."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "I shall inform them."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "And when such time they have begun to cry,"}
{"text": "Let them not cease, but with a din confused"}
{"text": "Enforce the present execution"}
{"text": "Of what we chance to sentence."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "Very well."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Make them be strong and ready for this hint,"}
{"text": "When we shall hap to give 't them."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Go about it."}
{"text": "Put him to choler straight: he hath been used"}
{"text": "Ever to conquer, and to have his worth"}
{"text": "Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot"}
{"text": "Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks"}
{"text": "What's in his heart; and that is there which looks"}
{"text": "With us to break his neck."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Well, here he comes."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Calmly, I do beseech you."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece"}
{"text": "Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods"}
{"text": "Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice"}
{"text": "Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!"}
{"text": "Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,"}
{"text": "And not our streets with war!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Amen, amen."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "A noble wish."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Draw near, ye people."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "First, hear me speak."}
{"text": "Both Tribunes:"}
{"text": "Well, say. Peace, ho!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Shall I be charged no further than this present?"}
{"text": "Must all determine here?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "I do demand,"}
{"text": "If you submit you to the people's voices,"}
{"text": "Allow their officers and are content"}
{"text": "To suffer lawful censure for such faults"}
{"text": "As shall be proved upon you?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I am content."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Lo, citizens, he says he is content:"}
{"text": "The warlike service he has done, consider; think"}
{"text": "Upon the wounds his body bears, which show"}
{"text": "Like graves i' the holy churchyard."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Scratches with briers,"}
{"text": "Scars to move laughter only."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Consider further,"}
{"text": "That when he speaks not like a citizen,"}
{"text": "You find him like a soldier: do not take"}
{"text": "His rougher accents for malicious sounds,"}
{"text": "But, as I say, such as become a soldier,"}
{"text": "Rather than envy you."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Well, well, no more."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What is the matter"}
{"text": "That being pass'd for consul with full voice,"}
{"text": "I am so dishonour'd that the very hour"}
{"text": "You take it off again?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Answer to us."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We charge you, that you have contrived to take"}
{"text": "From Rome all season'd office and to wind"}
{"text": "Yourself into a power tyrannical;"}
{"text": "For which you are a traitor to the people."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "How! traitor!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, temperately; your promise."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!"}
{"text": "Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!"}
{"text": "Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,"}
{"text": "In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in"}
{"text": "Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say"}
{"text": "'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free"}
{"text": "As I do pray the gods."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Mark you this, people?"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "To the rock, to the rock with him!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Peace!"}
{"text": "We need not put new matter to his charge:"}
{"text": "What you have seen him do and heard him speak,"}
{"text": "Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,"}
{"text": "Opposing laws with strokes and here defying"}
{"text": "Those whose great power must try him; even this,"}
{"text": "So criminal and in such capital kind,"}
{"text": "Deserves the extremest death."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "But since he hath"}
{"text": "Served well for Rome,--"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What do you prate of service?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "I talk of that, that know it."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "You?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Is this the promise that you made your mother?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Know, I pray you,--"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I know no further:"}
{"text": "Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,"}
{"text": "Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger"}
{"text": "But with a grain a day, I would not buy"}
{"text": "Their mercy at the price of one fair word;"}
{"text": "Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,"}
{"text": "To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "For that he has,"}
{"text": "As much as in him lies, from time to time"}
{"text": "Envied against the people, seeking means"}
{"text": "To pluck away their power, as now at last"}
{"text": "Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence"}
{"text": "Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers"}
{"text": "That do distribute it; in the name o' the people"}
{"text": "And in the power of us the tribunes, we,"}
{"text": "Even from this instant, banish him our city,"}
{"text": "In peril of precipitation"}
{"text": "From off the rock Tarpeian never more"}
{"text": "To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,"}
{"text": "I say it shall be so."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:"}
{"text": "He's banish'd, and it shall be so."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "He's sentenced; no more hearing."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Let me speak:"}
{"text": "I have been consul, and can show for Rome"}
{"text": "Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love"}
{"text": "My country's good with a respect more tender,"}
{"text": "More holy and profound, than mine own life,"}
{"text": "My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,"}
{"text": "And treasure of my loins; then if I would"}
{"text": "Speak that,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We know your drift: speak what?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,"}
{"text": "As enemy to the people and his country:"}
{"text": "It shall be so."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "It shall be so, it shall be so."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate"}
{"text": "As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize"}
{"text": "As the dead carcasses of unburied men"}
{"text": "That do corrupt my air, I banish you;"}
{"text": "And here remain with your uncertainty!"}
{"text": "Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!"}
{"text": "Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,"}
{"text": "Fan you into despair! Have the power still"}
{"text": "To banish your defenders; till at length"}
{"text": "Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,"}
{"text": "Making not reservation of yourselves,"}
{"text": "Still your own foes, deliver you as most"}
{"text": "Abated captives to some nation"}
{"text": "That won you without blows! Despising,"}
{"text": "For you, the city, thus I turn my back:"}
{"text": "There is a world elsewhere."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "The people's enemy is gone, is gone!"}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,"}
{"text": "As he hath followed you, with all despite;"}
{"text": "Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard"}
{"text": "Attend us through the city."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come."}
{"text": "The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast"}
{"text": "With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,"}
{"text": "Where is your ancient courage? you were used"}
{"text": "To say extremity was the trier of spirits;"}
{"text": "That common chances common men could bear;"}
{"text": "That when the sea was calm all boats alike"}
{"text": "Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,"}
{"text": "When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves"}
{"text": "A noble cunning: you were used to load me"}
{"text": "With precepts that would make invincible"}
{"text": "The heart that conn'd them."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "O heavens! O heavens!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Nay! prithee, woman,--"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,"}
{"text": "And occupations perish!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What, what, what!"}
{"text": "I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother."}
{"text": "Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,"}
{"text": "If you had been the wife of Hercules,"}
{"text": "Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved"}
{"text": "Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,"}
{"text": "Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:"}
{"text": "I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,"}
{"text": "Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,"}
{"text": "And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,"}
{"text": "I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld"}
{"text": "Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women"}
{"text": "'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,"}
{"text": "As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well"}
{"text": "My hazards still have been your solace: and"}
{"text": "Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,"}
{"text": "Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen"}
{"text": "Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son"}
{"text": "Will or exceed the common or be caught"}
{"text": "With cautelous baits and practise."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "My first son."}
{"text": "Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius"}
{"text": "With thee awhile: determine on some course,"}
{"text": "More than a wild exposture to each chance"}
{"text": "That starts i' the way before thee."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "O the gods!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee"}
{"text": "Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us"}
{"text": "And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth"}
{"text": "A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send"}
{"text": "O'er the vast world to seek a single man,"}
{"text": "And lose advantage, which doth ever cool"}
{"text": "I' the absence of the needer."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Fare ye well:"}
{"text": "Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full"}
{"text": "Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one"}
{"text": "That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate."}
{"text": "Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and"}
{"text": "My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,"}
{"text": "Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come."}
{"text": "While I remain above the ground, you shall"}
{"text": "Hear from me still, and never of me aught"}
{"text": "But what is like me formerly."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "That's worthily"}
{"text": "As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep."}
{"text": "If I could shake off but one seven years"}
{"text": "From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,"}
{"text": "I'ld with thee every foot."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Give me thy hand: Come."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further."}
{"text": "The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided"}
{"text": "In his behalf."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Now we have shown our power,"}
{"text": "Let us seem humbler after it is done"}
{"text": "Than when it was a-doing."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Bid them home:"}
{"text": "Say their great enemy is gone, and they"}
{"text": "Stand in their ancient strength."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Dismiss them home."}
{"text": "Here comes his mother."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Let's not meet her."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Why?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "They say she's mad."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods"}
{"text": "Requite your love!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Peace, peace; be not so loud."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--"}
{"text": "Nay, and you shall hear some."}
{"text": "Will you be gone?"}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Are you mankind?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool."}
{"text": "Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship"}
{"text": "To banish him that struck more blows for Rome"}
{"text": "Than thou hast spoken words?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "O blessed heavens!"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "More noble blows than ever thou wise words;"}
{"text": "And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:"}
{"text": "Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son"}
{"text": "Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,"}
{"text": "His good sword in his hand."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "What then?"}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "What then!"}
{"text": "He'ld make an end of thy posterity."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Bastards and all."}
{"text": "Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, come, peace."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "I would he had continued to his country"}
{"text": "As he began, and not unknit himself"}
{"text": "The noble knot he made."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "I would he had."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:"}
{"text": "Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth"}
{"text": "As I can of those mysteries which heaven"}
{"text": "Will not have earth to know."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Pray, let us go."}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Now, pray, sir, get you gone:"}
{"text": "You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--"}
{"text": "As far as doth the Capitol exceed"}
{"text": "The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--"}
{"text": "This lady's husband here, this, do you see--"}
{"text": "Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Well, well, we'll leave you."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Why stay we to be baited"}
{"text": "With one that wants her wits?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Take my prayers with you."}
{"text": "I would the gods had nothing else to do"}
{"text": "But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em"}
{"text": "But once a-day, it would unclog my heart"}
{"text": "Of what lies heavy to't."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You have told them home;"}
{"text": "And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?"}
{"text": "VOLUMNIA:"}
{"text": "Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,"}
{"text": "And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:"}
{"text": "Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,"}
{"text": "In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Fie, fie, fie!"}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "I know you well, sir, and you know"}
{"text": "me: your name, I think, is Adrian."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "I am a Roman; and my services are,"}
{"text": "as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?"}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "Nicanor? no."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "The same, sir."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "You had more beard when I last saw you; but your"}
{"text": "favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the"}

{"text": "people against the senators, patricians, and nobles."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not"}
{"text": "so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and"}
{"text": "hope to come upon them in the heat of their division."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing"}
{"text": "would make it flame again: for the nobles receive"}
{"text": "so to heart the banishment of that worthy"}
{"text": "Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take"}
{"text": "all power from the people and to pluck from them"}
{"text": "their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can"}
{"text": "tell you, and is almost mature for the violent"}
{"text": "breaking out."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "Coriolanus banished!"}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "Banished, sir."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "The day serves well for them now. I have heard it"}
{"text": "said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is"}
{"text": "when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble"}
{"text": "Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his"}
{"text": "great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request"}
{"text": "of his country."}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus"}
{"text": "accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my"}
{"text": "business, and I will merrily accompany you home."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "I shall, between this and supper, tell you most"}
{"text": "strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of"}
{"text": "their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?"}
{"text": "Volsce:"}
{"text": "A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,"}
{"text": "distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,"}
{"text": "and to be on foot at an hour's warning."}
{"text": "Roman:"}
{"text": "I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the"}

{"text": "So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company."}

{"text": "You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause"}

{"text": "Roman:"}

{"text": "Citizen:"}
{"text": "He is, and feasts the nobles of the state"}

{"text": "for him. Cotus!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I"}
{"text": "Appear not like a guest."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "What would you have, friend? whence are you?"}
{"text": "Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I have deserved no better entertainment,"}
{"text": "In being Coriolanus."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his"}
{"text": "head; that he gives entrance to such companions?"}
{"text": "Pray, get you out."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Away!"}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Away! get you away."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Now thou'rt troublesome."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "What fellow's this?"}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him"}
{"text": "out of the house: prithee, call my master to him."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid"}
{"text": "the house."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "What are you?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "A gentleman."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "A marvellous poor one."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "True, so I am."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other"}
{"text": "station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a"}

{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Where dwellest thou?"}

{"text": "Under the canopy!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ay."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Where's that?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I' the city of kites and crows."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!"}
{"text": "Then thou dwellest with daws too?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "No, I serve not thy master."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "How, sir! do you meddle with my master?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy"}
{"text": "mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy"}
{"text": "trencher, hence!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Where is this fellow?"}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for"}
{"text": "disturbing the lords within."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?"}
{"text": "Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "If, Tullus,"}
{"text": "Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not"}
{"text": "Think me for the man I am, necessity"}
{"text": "Commands me name myself."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "What is thy name?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,"}
{"text": "And harsh in sound to thine."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Say, what's thy name?"}
{"text": "Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face"}
{"text": "Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn."}
{"text": "Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st"}
{"text": "thou me yet?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I know thee not: thy name?"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done"}
{"text": "To thee particularly and to all the Volsces"}
{"text": "Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may"}
{"text": "My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,"}
{"text": "The extreme dangers and the drops of blood"}
{"text": "Shed for my thankless country are requited"}
{"text": "But with that surname; a good memory,"}
{"text": "And witness of the malice and displeasure"}
{"text": "Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;"}
{"text": "The cruelty and envy of the people,"}
{"text": "Permitted by our dastard nobles, who"}
{"text": "Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;"}
{"text": "And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be"}
{"text": "Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity"}
{"text": "Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--"}
{"text": "Mistake me not--to save my life, for if"}
{"text": "I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world"}
{"text": "I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,"}
{"text": "To be full quit of those my banishers,"}
{"text": "Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast"}
{"text": "A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge"}
{"text": "Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims"}
{"text": "Of shame seen through thy country, speed"}
{"text": "thee straight,"}
{"text": "And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it"}
{"text": "That my revengeful services may prove"}
{"text": "As benefits to thee, for I will fight"}
{"text": "Against my canker'd country with the spleen"}
{"text": "Of all the under fiends. But if so be"}
{"text": "Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes"}
{"text": "Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am"}
{"text": "Longer to live most weary, and present"}
{"text": "My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;"}
{"text": "Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,"}
{"text": "Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,"}
{"text": "Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,"}
{"text": "And cannot live but to thy shame, unless"}
{"text": "It be to do thee service."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "O Marcius, Marcius!"}
{"text": "Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart"}
{"text": "A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter"}
{"text": "Should from yond cloud speak divine things,"}
{"text": "And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more"}
{"text": "Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine"}
{"text": "Mine arms about that body, where against"}
{"text": "My grained ash an hundred times hath broke"}
{"text": "And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip"}
{"text": "The anvil of my sword, and do contest"}
{"text": "As hotly and as nobly with thy love"}
{"text": "As ever in ambitious strength I did"}
{"text": "Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,"}
{"text": "I loved the maid I married; never man"}
{"text": "Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,"}
{"text": "Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart"}
{"text": "Than when I first my wedded mistress saw"}
{"text": "Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,"}
{"text": "We have a power on foot; and I had purpose"}
{"text": "Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,"}
{"text": "Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out"}
{"text": "Twelve several times, and I have nightly since"}
{"text": "Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;"}
{"text": "We have been down together in my sleep,"}
{"text": "Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,"}
{"text": "And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,"}
{"text": "Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that"}
{"text": "Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all"}
{"text": "From twelve to seventy, and pouring war"}
{"text": "Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,"}
{"text": "Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,"}
{"text": "And take our friendly senators by the hands;"}
{"text": "Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,"}
{"text": "Who am prepared against your territories,"}
{"text": "Though not for Rome itself."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "You bless me, gods!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have"}
{"text": "The leading of thine own revenges, take"}
{"text": "The one half of my commission; and set down--"}
{"text": "As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st"}
{"text": "Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;"}
{"text": "Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,"}
{"text": "Or rudely visit them in parts remote,"}
{"text": "To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:"}
{"text": "Let me commend thee first to those that shall"}
{"text": "Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!"}
{"text": "And more a friend than e'er an enemy;"}
{"text": "Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!"}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Here's a strange alteration!"}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with"}
{"text": "a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a"}
{"text": "false report of him."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "What an arm he has! he turned me about with his"}
{"text": "finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in"}
{"text": "him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I"}
{"text": "cannot tell how to term it."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,"}
{"text": "but I thought there was more in him than I could think."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest"}
{"text": "man i' the world."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Who, my master?"}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Nay, it's no matter for that."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Worth six on him."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the"}
{"text": "greater soldier."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:"}
{"text": "for the defence of a town, our general is excellent."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Ay, and for an assault too."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!"}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "What, what, what? let's partake."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as"}
{"text": "lieve be a condemned man."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Wherefore? wherefore?"}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,"}
{"text": "Caius Marcius."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Why do you say 'thwack our general '?"}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always"}
{"text": "good enough for him."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too"}
{"text": "hard for him; I have heard him say so himself."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth"}
{"text": "on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched"}
{"text": "him like a carbon ado."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "An he had been cannibally given, he might have"}
{"text": "broiled and eaten him too."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "But, more of thy news?"}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son"}
{"text": "and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no"}
{"text": "question asked him by any of the senators, but they"}
{"text": "stand bald before him: our general himself makes a"}
{"text": "mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and"}
{"text": "turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But"}
{"text": "the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'"}
{"text": "the middle and but one half of what he was"}
{"text": "yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty"}
{"text": "and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,"}
{"text": "and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he"}
{"text": "will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as"}
{"text": "many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it"}
{"text": "were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as"}
{"text": "we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Directitude! what's that?"}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,"}
{"text": "and the man in blood, they will out of their"}
{"text": "burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "But when goes this forward?"}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the"}
{"text": "drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a"}
{"text": "parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they"}
{"text": "wipe their lips."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "Why, then we shall have a stirring world again."}
{"text": "This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase"}
{"text": "tailors, and breed ballad-makers."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as"}
{"text": "day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and"}
{"text": "full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;"}
{"text": "mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more"}
{"text": "bastard children than war's a destroyer of men."}
{"text": "Second Servingman:"}
{"text": "'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to"}
{"text": "be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a"}
{"text": "great maker of cuckolds."}
{"text": "First Servingman:"}
{"text": "Ay, and it makes men hate one another."}
{"text": "Third Servingman:"}
{"text": "Reason; because they then less need one another."}
{"text": "The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap"}
{"text": "as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising."}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "In, in, in, in!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;"}
{"text": "His remedies are tame i' the present peace"}
{"text": "And quietness of the people, which before"}
{"text": "Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends"}
{"text": "Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,"}
{"text": "Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold"}
{"text": "Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see"}
{"text": "Our tradesmen with in their shops and going"}
{"text": "About their functions friendly."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "We stood to't in good time."}
{"text": "Is this Menenius?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late."}
{"text": "Both Tribunes:"}
{"text": "Hail sir!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Hail to you both!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Your Coriolanus"}
{"text": "Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:"}
{"text": "The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,"}
{"text": "Were he more angry at it."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "All's well; and might have been much better, if"}
{"text": "He could have temporized."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Where is he, hear you?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife"}
{"text": "Hear nothing from him."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "The gods preserve you both!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "God-den, our neighbours."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "God-den to you all, god-den to you all."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,"}
{"text": "Are bound to pray for you both."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Live, and thrive!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus"}
{"text": "Had loved you as we did."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Now the gods keep you!"}
{"text": "Both Tribunes:"}
{"text": "Farewell, farewell."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This is a happier and more comely time"}
{"text": "Than when these fellows ran about the streets,"}
{"text": "Crying confusion."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Caius Marcius was"}
{"text": "A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,"}
{"text": "O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,"}
{"text": "Self-loving,--"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "And affecting one sole throne,"}
{"text": "Without assistance."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I think not so."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We should by this, to all our lamentation,"}
{"text": "If he had gone forth consul, found it so."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "The gods have well prevented it, and Rome"}
{"text": "Sits safe and still without him."}
{"text": "AEdile:"}
{"text": "Worthy tribunes,"}
{"text": "There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,"}
{"text": "Reports, the Volsces with two several powers"}
{"text": "Are enter'd in the Roman territories,"}
{"text": "And with the deepest malice of the war"}
{"text": "Destroy what lies before 'em."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis Aufidius,"}
{"text": "Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,"}
{"text": "Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;"}
{"text": "Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,"}
{"text": "And durst not once peep out."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Come, what talk you"}
{"text": "Of Marcius?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be"}
{"text": "The Volsces dare break with us."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Cannot be!"}
{"text": "We have record that very well it can,"}
{"text": "And three examples of the like have been"}
{"text": "Within my age. But reason with the fellow,"}
{"text": "Before you punish him, where he heard this,"}
{"text": "Lest you shall chance to whip your information"}
{"text": "And beat the messenger who bids beware"}
{"text": "Of what is to be dreaded."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Tell not me:"}
{"text": "I know this cannot be."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Not possible."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The nobles in great earnestness are going"}
{"text": "All to the senate-house: some news is come"}
{"text": "That turns their countenances."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis this slave;--"}
{"text": "Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;"}
{"text": "Nothing but his report."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Yes, worthy sir,"}
{"text": "The slave's report is seconded; and more,"}
{"text": "More fearful, is deliver'd."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "What more fearful?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "It is spoke freely out of many mouths--"}
{"text": "How probable I do not know--that Marcius,"}
{"text": "Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,"}
{"text": "And vows revenge as spacious as between"}
{"text": "The young'st and oldest thing."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "This is most likely!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish"}
{"text": "Good Marcius home again."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "The very trick on't."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "This is unlikely:"}
{"text": "He and Aufidius can no more atone"}
{"text": "Than violentest contrariety."}
{"text": "Second Messenger:"}
{"text": "You are sent for to the senate:"}
{"text": "A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius"}
{"text": "Associated with Aufidius, rages"}
{"text": "Upon our territories; and have already"}
{"text": "O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took"}
{"text": "What lay before them."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "O, you have made good work!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What news? what news?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "You have holp to ravish your own daughters and"}
{"text": "To melt the city leads upon your pates,"}
{"text": "To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What's the news? what's the news?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Your temples burned in their cement, and"}
{"text": "Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined"}
{"text": "Into an auger's bore."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray now, your news?"}
{"text": "You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--"}
{"text": "If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "If!"}
{"text": "He is their god: he leads them like a thing"}
{"text": "Made by some other deity than nature,"}
{"text": "That shapes man better; and they follow him,"}
{"text": "Against us brats, with no less confidence"}
{"text": "Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,"}
{"text": "Or butchers killing flies."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You have made good work,"}
{"text": "You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much"}
{"text": "on the voice of occupation and"}
{"text": "The breath of garlic-eaters!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "He will shake"}
{"text": "Your Rome about your ears."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "As Hercules"}
{"text": "Did shake down mellow fruit."}
{"text": "You have made fair work!"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "But is this true, sir?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay; and you'll look pale"}
{"text": "Before you find it other. All the regions"}
{"text": "Do smilingly revolt; and who resist"}
{"text": "Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,"}
{"text": "And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?"}
{"text": "Your enemies and his find something in him."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "We are all undone, unless"}
{"text": "The noble man have mercy."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Who shall ask it?"}
{"text": "The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people"}
{"text": "Deserve such pity of him as the wolf"}
{"text": "Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they"}
{"text": "Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even"}
{"text": "As those should do that had deserved his hate,"}
{"text": "And therein show'd like enemies."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "'Tis true:"}
{"text": "If he were putting to my house the brand"}
{"text": "That should consume it, I have not the face"}
{"text": "To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,"}
{"text": "You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "You have brought"}
{"text": "A trembling upon Rome, such as was never"}
{"text": "So incapable of help."}
{"text": "Both Tribunes:"}
{"text": "Say not we brought it."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts"}
{"text": "And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,"}
{"text": "Who did hoot him out o' the city."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "But I fear"}
{"text": "They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,"}
{"text": "The second name of men, obeys his points"}
{"text": "As if he were his officer: desperation"}
{"text": "Is all the policy, strength and defence,"}
{"text": "That Rome can make against them."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Here come the clusters."}
{"text": "And is Aufidius with him? You are they"}
{"text": "That made the air unwholesome, when you cast"}
{"text": "Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at"}
{"text": "Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;"}
{"text": "And not a hair upon a soldier's head"}
{"text": "Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs"}
{"text": "As you threw caps up will he tumble down,"}
{"text": "And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;"}
{"text": "if he could burn us all into one coal,"}
{"text": "We have deserved it."}
{"text": "Citizens:"}
{"text": "Faith, we hear fearful news."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "For mine own part,"}
{"text": "When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "And so did I."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very"}
{"text": "many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and"}
{"text": "though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet"}
{"text": "it was against our will."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Ye re goodly things, you voices!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You have made"}
{"text": "Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "O, ay, what else?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:"}
{"text": "These are a side that would be glad to have"}
{"text": "This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,"}
{"text": "And show no sign of fear."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home."}
{"text": "I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "So did we all. But, come, let's home."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "I do not like this news."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Nor I."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth"}
{"text": "Would buy this for a lie!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray, let us go."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Do they still fly to the Roman?"}
{"text": "Lieutenant:"}
{"text": "I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but"}
{"text": "Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,"}
{"text": "Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;"}
{"text": "And you are darken'd in this action, sir,"}
{"text": "Even by your own."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I cannot help it now,"}
{"text": "Unless, by using means, I lame the foot"}
{"text": "Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,"}
{"text": "Even to my person, than I thought he would"}
{"text": "When first I did embrace him: yet his nature"}
{"text": "In that's no changeling; and I must excuse"}
{"text": "What cannot be amended."}
{"text": "Lieutenant:"}
{"text": "Yet I wish, sir,--"}
{"text": "I mean for your particular,--you had not"}
{"text": "Join'd in commission with him; but either"}
{"text": "Had borne the action of yourself, or else"}
{"text": "To him had left it solely."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I understand thee well; and be thou sure,"}
{"text": "when he shall come to his account, he knows not"}
{"text": "What I can urge against him. Although it seems,"}
{"text": "And so he thinks, and is no less apparent"}
{"text": "To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly."}
{"text": "And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,"}
{"text": "Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon"}
{"text": "As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone"}
{"text": "That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,"}
{"text": "Whene'er we come to our account."}
{"text": "Lieutenant:"}
{"text": "Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "All places yield to him ere he sits down;"}
{"text": "And the nobility of Rome are his:"}
{"text": "The senators and patricians love him too:"}
{"text": "The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people"}
{"text": "Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty"}
{"text": "To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome"}
{"text": "As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it"}
{"text": "By sovereignty of nature. First he was"}
{"text": "A noble servant to them; but he could not"}
{"text": "Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,"}
{"text": "Which out of daily fortune ever taints"}
{"text": "The happy man; whether defect of judgment,"}
{"text": "To fail in the disposing of those chances"}
{"text": "Which he was lord of; or whether nature,"}
{"text": "Not to be other than one thing, not moving"}
{"text": "From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace"}
{"text": "Even with the same austerity and garb"}
{"text": "As he controll'd the war; but one of these--"}
{"text": "As he hath spices of them all, not all,"}
{"text": "For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,"}
{"text": "So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,"}
{"text": "To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues"}
{"text": "Lie in the interpretation of the time:"}
{"text": "And power, unto itself most commendable,"}
{"text": "Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair"}
{"text": "To extol what it hath done."}
{"text": "One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;"}
{"text": "Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail."}
{"text": "Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,"}
{"text": "Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said"}
{"text": "Which was sometime his general; who loved him"}
{"text": "In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:"}
{"text": "But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;"}
{"text": "A mile before his tent fall down, and knee"}
{"text": "The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd"}
{"text": "To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "He would not seem to know me."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Do you hear?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "Yet one time he did call me by my name:"}
{"text": "I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops"}
{"text": "That we have bled together. Coriolanus"}
{"text": "He would not answer to: forbad all names;"}
{"text": "He was a kind of nothing, titleless,"}
{"text": "Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire"}
{"text": "Of burning Rome."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, so: you have made good work!"}
{"text": "A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,"}
{"text": "To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon"}
{"text": "When it was less expected: he replied,"}
{"text": "It was a bare petition of a state"}
{"text": "To one whom they had punish'd."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Very well:"}
{"text": "Could he say less?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I offer'd to awaken his regard"}
{"text": "For's private friends: his answer to me was,"}
{"text": "He could not stay to pick them in a pile"}
{"text": "Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,"}
{"text": "For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,"}
{"text": "And still to nose the offence."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "For one poor grain or two!"}
{"text": "I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,"}
{"text": "And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:"}
{"text": "You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt"}
{"text": "Above the moon: we must be burnt for you."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid"}
{"text": "In this so never-needed help, yet do not"}
{"text": "Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you"}
{"text": "Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,"}
{"text": "More than the instant army we can make,"}
{"text": "Might stop our countryman."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "No, I'll not meddle."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Pray you, go to him."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "What should I do?"}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "Only make trial what your love can do"}
{"text": "For Rome, towards Marcius."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Well, and say that Marcius"}
{"text": "Return me, as Cominius is return'd,"}
{"text": "Unheard; what then?"}
{"text": "But as a discontented friend, grief-shot"}
{"text": "With his unkindness? say't be so?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Yet your good will"}
{"text": "must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure"}
{"text": "As you intended well."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I'll undertake 't:"}
{"text": "I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip"}
{"text": "And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me."}
{"text": "He was not taken well; he had not dined:"}
{"text": "The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then"}
{"text": "We pout upon the morning, are unapt"}
{"text": "To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd"}
{"text": "These and these conveyances of our blood"}
{"text": "With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls"}
{"text": "Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him"}
{"text": "Till he be dieted to my request,"}
{"text": "And then I'll set upon him."}
{"text": "BRUTUS:"}
{"text": "You know the very road into his kindness,"}
{"text": "And cannot lose your way."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Good faith, I'll prove him,"}
{"text": "Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge"}
{"text": "Of my success."}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "He'll never hear him."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Not?"}
{"text": "COMINIUS:"}
{"text": "I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye"}
{"text": "Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury"}
{"text": "The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;"}
{"text": "'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me"}
{"text": "Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,"}
{"text": "He sent in writing after me; what he would not,"}
{"text": "Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:"}
{"text": "So that all hope is vain."}
{"text": "Unless his noble mother, and his wife;"}
{"text": "Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him"}
{"text": "For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,"}
{"text": "And with our fair entreaties haste them on."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Stay: whence are you?"}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Stand, and go back."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,"}
{"text": "I am an officer of state, and come"}
{"text": "To speak with Coriolanus."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "From whence?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "From Rome."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "You may not pass, you must return: our general"}
{"text": "Will no more hear from thence."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before"}
{"text": "You'll speak with Coriolanus."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Good my friends,"}
{"text": "If you have heard your general talk of Rome,"}
{"text": "And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,"}
{"text": "My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name"}
{"text": "Is not here passable."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I tell thee, fellow,"}
{"text": "The general is my lover: I have been"}
{"text": "The book of his good acts, whence men have read"}
{"text": "His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;"}
{"text": "For I have ever verified my friends,"}
{"text": "Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity"}
{"text": "Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,"}
{"text": "Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,"}
{"text": "I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise"}
{"text": "Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,"}
{"text": "I must have leave to pass."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his"}
{"text": "behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you"}
{"text": "should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous"}
{"text": "to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,"}
{"text": "always factionary on the party of your general."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you"}
{"text": "have, I am one that, telling true under him, must"}
{"text": "say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not"}
{"text": "speak with him till after dinner."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "You are a Roman, are you?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I am, as thy general is."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,"}
{"text": "when you have pushed out your gates the very"}
{"text": "defender of them, and, in a violent popular"}
{"text": "ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to"}
{"text": "front his revenges with the easy groans of old"}
{"text": "women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with"}
{"text": "the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as"}
{"text": "you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the"}
{"text": "intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with"}
{"text": "such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;"}
{"text": "therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your"}
{"text": "execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn"}
{"text": "you out of reprieve and pardon."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would"}
{"text": "use me with estimation."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "Come, my captain knows you not."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I mean, thy general."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest"}
{"text": "I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's"}
{"text": "the utmost of your having: back."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "What's the matter?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:"}
{"text": "You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall"}
{"text": "perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from"}
{"text": "my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment"}
{"text": "with him, if thou standest not i' the state of"}
{"text": "hanging, or of some death more long in"}
{"text": "spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now"}
{"text": "presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee."}
{"text": "The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy"}
{"text": "particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than"}
{"text": "thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!"}
{"text": "thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's"}
{"text": "water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to"}
{"text": "thee; but being assured none but myself could move"}
{"text": "thee, I have been blown out of your gates with"}
{"text": "sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy"}
{"text": "petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy"}
{"text": "wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet"}
{"text": "here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my"}
{"text": "access to thee."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Away!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "How! away!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs"}
{"text": "Are servanted to others: though I owe"}
{"text": "My revenge properly, my remission lies"}
{"text": "In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,"}
{"text": "Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather"}
{"text": "Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone."}
{"text": "Mine ears against your suits are stronger than"}
{"text": "Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,"}
{"text": "Take this along; I writ it for thy sake"}
{"text": "And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,"}
{"text": "I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,"}
{"text": "Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "You keep a constant temper."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Now, sir, is your name Menenius?"}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the"}
{"text": "way home again."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your"}
{"text": "greatness back?"}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I neither care for the world nor your general: for"}
{"text": "such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,"}
{"text": "ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by"}
{"text": "himself fears it not from another: let your general"}
{"text": "do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and"}
{"text": "your misery increase with your age! I say to you,"}
{"text": "as I was said to, Away!"}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "A noble fellow, I warrant him."}
{"text": "Second Senator:"}
{"text": "The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the"}
{"text": "oak not to be wind-shaken."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow"}
{"text": "Set down our host. My partner in this action,"}
{"text": "You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly"}
{"text": "I have borne this business."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Only their ends"}
{"text": "You have respected; stopp'd your ears against"}
{"text": "The general suit of Rome; never admitted"}
{"text": "A private whisper, no, not with such friends"}
{"text": "That thought them sure of you."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "This last old man,"}
{"text": "Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,"}
{"text": "Loved me above the measure of a father;"}
{"text": "Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge"}
{"text": "Was to send him; for whose old love I have,"}
{"text": "Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd"}
{"text": "The first conditions, which they did refuse"}
{"text": "And cannot now accept; to grace him only"}
{"text": "That thought he could do more, a very little"}
{"text": "I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,"}
{"text": "Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter"}
{"text": "Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?"}
{"text": "Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow"}
{"text": "In the same time 'tis made? I will not."}
{"text": "My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould"}
{"text": "Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand"}
{"text": "The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!"}
{"text": "All bond and privilege of nature, break!"}
{"text": "Let it be virtuous to be obstinate."}
{"text": "What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,"}
{"text": "Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not"}
{"text": "Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;"}
{"text": "As if Olympus to a molehill should"}
{"text": "In supplication nod: and my young boy"}
{"text": "Hath an aspect of intercession, which"}
{"text": "Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces"}
{"text": "Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never"}
{"text": "Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,"}
{"text": "As if a man were author of himself"}
{"text": "And knew no other kin."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "My lord and husband!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome."}
{"text": "VIRGILIA:"}
{"text": "The sorrow that delivers us thus changed"}
{"text": "Makes you think so."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Like a dull actor now,"}
{"text": "I have forgot my part, and I am out,"}
{"text": "Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,"}
{"text": "Forgive my tyranny; but do not say"}
{"text": "For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss"}
{"text": "Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!"}
{"text": "Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss"}
{"text": "I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip"}
{"text": "Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,"}
{"text": "And the most noble mother of the world"}
{"text": "Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;"}
{"text": "Of thy deep duty more impression show"}
{"text": "Than that of common sons."}

{"text": "To imitate the graces of the gods;"}
{"text": "To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,"}
{"text": "And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt"}

{"text": "This boy, that cannot tell what he would have"}
{"text": "But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,"}

{"text": "A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I was moved withal."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "I dare be sworn you were:"}
{"text": "And, sir, it is no little thing to make"}

{"text": "What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,"}
{"text": "I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,"}
{"text": "Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, by and by;"}
{"text": "But we will drink together; and you shall bear"}
{"text": "A better witness back than words, which we,"}
{"text": "On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd."}
{"text": "Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve"}
{"text": "To have a temple built you: all the swords"}
{"text": "In Italy, and her confederate arms,"}
{"text": "Could not have made this peace."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond"}
{"text": "corner-stone?"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, what of that?"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "If it be possible for you to displace it with your"}
{"text": "little finger, there is some hope the ladies of"}
{"text": "Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him."}
{"text": "But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are"}
{"text": "sentenced and stay upon execution."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Is't possible that so short a time can alter the"}
{"text": "condition of a man!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;"}
{"text": "yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown"}
{"text": "from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a"}
{"text": "creeping thing."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "He loved his mother dearly."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother"}
{"text": "now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness"}
{"text": "of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he"}
{"text": "moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before"}
{"text": "his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with"}
{"text": "his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a"}
{"text": "battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for"}
{"text": "Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with"}
{"text": "his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity"}
{"text": "and a heaven to throne in."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Yes, mercy, if you report him truly."}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his"}
{"text": "mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy"}
{"text": "in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that"}
{"text": "shall our poor city find: and all this is long of"}
{"text": "you."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "The gods be good unto us!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto"}
{"text": "us. When we banished him, we respected not them;"}
{"text": "and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:"}
{"text": "The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune"}
{"text": "And hale him up and down, all swearing, if"}
{"text": "The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,"}
{"text": "They'll give him death by inches."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "What's the news?"}
{"text": "Second Messenger:"}
{"text": "Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,"}
{"text": "The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:"}
{"text": "A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,"}
{"text": "No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "Friend,"}
{"text": "Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?"}
{"text": "Second Messenger:"}
{"text": "As certain as I know the sun is fire:"}
{"text": "Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?"}
{"text": "Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,"}
{"text": "As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!"}
{"text": "The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,"}
{"text": "Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,"}
{"text": "Make the sun dance. Hark you!"}
{"text": "MENENIUS:"}
{"text": "This is good news:"}
{"text": "I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia"}
{"text": "Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,"}
{"text": "A city full; of tribunes, such as you,"}
{"text": "A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:"}
{"text": "This morning for ten thousand of your throats"}
{"text": "I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!"}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,"}
{"text": "Accept my thankfulness."}
{"text": "Second Messenger:"}
{"text": "Sir, we have all"}
{"text": "Great cause to give great thanks."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "They are near the city?"}
{"text": "Second Messenger:"}
{"text": "Almost at point to enter."}
{"text": "SICINIUS:"}
{"text": "We will meet them,"}
{"text": "And help the joy."}
{"text": "First Senator:"}
{"text": "Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!"}
{"text": "Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,"}
{"text": "And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:"}
{"text": "Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,"}
{"text": "Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;"}
{"text": "Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'"}
{"text": "All:"}
{"text": "Welcome, ladies, Welcome!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:"}
{"text": "Deliver them this paper: having read it,"}
{"text": "Bid them repair to the market place; where I,"}
{"text": "Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,"}
{"text": "Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse"}
{"text": "The city ports by this hath enter'd and"}
{"text": "Intends to appear before the people, hoping"}
{"text": "To purge herself with words: dispatch."}
{"text": "Most welcome!"}
{"text": "First Conspirator:"}
{"text": "How is it with our general?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Even so"}
{"text": "As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,"}
{"text": "And with his charity slain."}
{"text": "Second Conspirator:"}
{"text": "Most noble sir,"}
{"text": "If you do hold the same intent wherein"}
{"text": "You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you"}
{"text": "Of your great danger."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Sir, I cannot tell:"}
{"text": "We must proceed as we do find the people."}
{"text": "Third Conspirator:"}
{"text": "The people will remain uncertain whilst"}
{"text": "'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either"}
{"text": "Makes the survivor heir of all."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I know it;"}
{"text": "And my pretext to strike at him admits"}
{"text": "A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd"}
{"text": "Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,"}
{"text": "He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,"}
{"text": "Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,"}
{"text": "He bow'd his nature, never known before"}
{"text": "But to be rough, unswayable and free."}
{"text": "Third Conspirator:"}
{"text": "Sir, his stoutness"}
{"text": "When he did stand for consul, which he lost"}
{"text": "By lack of stooping,--"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "That I would have spoke of:"}
{"text": "Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;"}
{"text": "Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;"}
{"text": "Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way"}
{"text": "In all his own desires; nay, let him choose"}
{"text": "Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,"}
{"text": "My best and freshest men; served his designments"}
{"text": "In mine own person; holp to reap the fame"}
{"text": "Which he did end all his; and took some pride"}
{"text": "To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,"}
{"text": "I seem'd his follower, not partner, and"}
{"text": "He waged me with his countenance, as if"}
{"text": "I had been mercenary."}
{"text": "First Conspirator:"}
{"text": "So he did, my lord:"}
{"text": "The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,"}
{"text": "When he had carried Rome and that we look'd"}
{"text": "For no less spoil than glory,--"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "There was it:"}
{"text": "For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him."}
{"text": "At a few drops of women's rheum, which are"}
{"text": "As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour"}
{"text": "Of our great action: therefore shall he die,"}
{"text": "And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!"}
{"text": "First Conspirator:"}
{"text": "Your native town you enter'd like a post,"}
{"text": "And had no welcomes home: but he returns,"}
{"text": "Splitting the air with noise."}
{"text": "Second Conspirator:"}
{"text": "And patient fools,"}
{"text": "Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear"}
{"text": "With giving him glory."}
{"text": "Third Conspirator:"}
{"text": "Therefore, at your vantage,"}
{"text": "Ere he express himself, or move the people"}
{"text": "With what he would say, let him feel your sword,"}
{"text": "Which we will second. When he lies along,"}
{"text": "After your way his tale pronounced shall bury"}
{"text": "His reasons with his body."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Say no more:"}
{"text": "Here come the lords."}
{"text": "All The Lords:"}
{"text": "You are most welcome home."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "I have not deserved it."}
{"text": "But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused"}
{"text": "What I have written to you?"}
{"text": "Lords:"}
{"text": "We have."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "And grieve to hear't."}
{"text": "What faults he made before the last, I think"}
{"text": "Might have found easy fines: but there to end"}
{"text": "Where he was to begin and give away"}
{"text": "The benefit of our levies, answering us"}
{"text": "With our own charge, making a treaty where"}
{"text": "There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "He approaches: you shall hear him."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,"}
{"text": "No more infected with my country's love"}
{"text": "Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting"}
{"text": "Under your great command. You are to know"}
{"text": "That prosperously I have attempted and"}
{"text": "With bloody passage led your wars even to"}
{"text": "The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home"}
{"text": "Do more than counterpoise a full third part"}
{"text": "The charges of the action. We have made peace"}
{"text": "With no less honour to the Antiates"}
{"text": "Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,"}
{"text": "Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,"}
{"text": "Together with the seal o' the senate, what"}
{"text": "We have compounded on."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Read it not, noble lords;"}
{"text": "But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree"}
{"text": "He hath abused your powers."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Traitor! how now!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, traitor, Marcius!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Marcius!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think"}
{"text": "I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name"}
{"text": "Coriolanus in Corioli?"}
{"text": "You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously"}
{"text": "He has betray'd your business, and given up,"}
{"text": "For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,"}
{"text": "I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;"}
{"text": "Breaking his oath and resolution like"}
{"text": "A twist of rotten silk, never admitting"}
{"text": "Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears"}
{"text": "He whined and roar'd away your victory,"}
{"text": "That pages blush'd at him and men of heart"}
{"text": "Look'd wondering each at other."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Hear'st thou, Mars?"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Name not the god, thou boy of tears!"}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Ha!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "No more."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart"}
{"text": "Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!"}
{"text": "Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever"}
{"text": "I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,"}
{"text": "Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--"}
{"text": "Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that"}
{"text": "Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join"}
{"text": "To thrust the lie unto him."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Peace, both, and hear me speak."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,"}
{"text": "Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!"}
{"text": "If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,"}
{"text": "That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I"}
{"text": "Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:"}
{"text": "Alone I did it. Boy!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Why, noble lords,"}
{"text": "Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,"}
{"text": "Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,"}
{"text": "'Fore your own eyes and ears?"}
{"text": "All Conspirators:"}
{"text": "Let him die for't."}
{"text": "All The People:"}
{"text": "'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd"}
{"text": "my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin"}
{"text": "Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'"}
{"text": "Second Lord:"}
{"text": "Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!"}
{"text": "The man is noble and his fame folds-in"}
{"text": "This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us"}
{"text": "Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,"}
{"text": "And trouble not the peace."}
{"text": "CORIOLANUS:"}
{"text": "O that I had him,"}
{"text": "With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,"}
{"text": "To use my lawful sword!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "Insolent villain!"}
{"text": "All Conspirators:"}
{"text": "Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!"}
{"text": "Lords:"}
{"text": "Hold, hold, hold, hold!"}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "My noble masters, hear me speak."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "O Tullus,--"}
{"text": "Second Lord:"}
{"text": "Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep."}
{"text": "Third Lord:"}
{"text": "Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;"}
{"text": "Put up your swords."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,"}
{"text": "Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger"}
{"text": "Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice"}
{"text": "That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours"}
{"text": "To call me to your senate, I'll deliver"}
{"text": "Myself your loyal servant, or endure"}
{"text": "Your heaviest censure."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Bear from hence his body;"}
{"text": "And mourn you for him: let him be regarded"}
{"text": "As the most noble corse that ever herald"}
{"text": "Did follow to his urn."}
{"text": "Second Lord:"}
{"text": "His own impatience"}
{"text": "Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame."}
{"text": "Let's make the best of it."}
{"text": "AUFIDIUS:"}
{"text": "My rage is gone;"}
{"text": "And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up."}
{"text": "Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one."}
{"text": "Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:"}
{"text": "Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he"}
{"text": "Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,"}
{"text": "Which to this hour bewail the injury,"}
{"text": "Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Now is the winter of our discontent"}
{"text": "Made glorious summer by this sun of York;"}
{"text": "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house"}
{"text": "In the deep bosom of the ocean buried."}
{"text": "Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;"}
{"text": "Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;"}
{"text": "Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,"}
{"text": "Our dreadful marches to delightful measures."}
{"text": "Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;"}
{"text": "And now, instead of mounting barded steeds"}
{"text": "To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,"}
{"text": "He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber"}
{"text": "To the lascivious pleasing of a lute."}
{"text": "But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,"}
{"text": "Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;"}
{"text": "I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty"}
{"text": "To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;"}
{"text": "I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,"}
{"text": "Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,"}
{"text": "Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time"}
{"text": "Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,"}
{"text": "And that so lamely and unfashionable"}
{"text": "That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;"}
{"text": "Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,"}
{"text": "Have no delight to pass away the time,"}
{"text": "Unless to spy my shadow in the sun"}
{"text": "And descant on mine own deformity:"}
{"text": "And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,"}
{"text": "To entertain these fair well-spoken days,"}
{"text": "I am determined to prove a villain"}
{"text": "And hate the idle pleasures of these days."}
{"text": "Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,"}
{"text": "By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,"}
{"text": "To set my brother Clarence and the king"}
{"text": "In deadly hate the one against the other:"}
{"text": "And if King Edward be as true and just"}
{"text": "As I am subtle, false and treacherous,"}
{"text": "This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,"}
{"text": "About a prophecy, which says that 'G'"}
{"text": "Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be."}
{"text": "Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here"}
{"text": "Clarence comes."}
{"text": "Brother, good day; what means this armed guard"}
{"text": "That waits upon your grace?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "His majesty"}
{"text": "Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed"}
{"text": "This conduct to convey me to the Tower."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Upon what cause?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Because my name is George."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;"}
{"text": "He should, for that, commit your godfathers:"}
{"text": "O, belike his majesty hath some intent"}
{"text": "That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower."}
{"text": "But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest"}
{"text": "As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,"}
{"text": "He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;"}
{"text": "And from the cross-row plucks the letter G."}
{"text": "And says a wizard told him that by G"}
{"text": "His issue disinherited should be;"}
{"text": "And, for my name of George begins with G,"}
{"text": "It follows in his thought that I am he."}
{"text": "These, as I learn, and such like toys as these"}
{"text": "Have moved his highness to commit me now."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:"}
{"text": "'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:"}
{"text": "My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she"}
{"text": "That tempers him to this extremity."}
{"text": "Was it not she and that good man of worship,"}
{"text": "Anthony Woodville, her brother there,"}
{"text": "That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,"}
{"text": "From whence this present day he is deliver'd?"}
{"text": "We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "By heaven, I think there's no man is secure"}
{"text": "But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds"}
{"text": "That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore."}
{"text": "Heard ye not what an humble suppliant"}
{"text": "Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Humbly complaining to her deity"}
{"text": "Got my lord chamberlain his liberty."}
{"text": "I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,"}
{"text": "If we will keep in favour with the king,"}
{"text": "To be her men and wear her livery:"}
{"text": "The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,"}
{"text": "Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen."}
{"text": "Are mighty gossips in this monarchy."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "I beseech your graces both to pardon me;"}
{"text": "His majesty hath straitly given in charge"}
{"text": "That no man shall have private conference,"}
{"text": "Of what degree soever, with his brother."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,"}
{"text": "You may partake of any thing we say:"}
{"text": "We speak no treason, man: we say the king"}
{"text": "Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen"}
{"text": "Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;"}
{"text": "We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,"}
{"text": "A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;"}
{"text": "And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:"}
{"text": "How say you sir? Can you deny all this?"}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "With this, my lord, myself have nought to do."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,"}
{"text": "He that doth naught with her, excepting one,"}
{"text": "Were best he do it secretly, alone."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "What one, my lord?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?"}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal"}
{"text": "Forbear your conference with the noble duke."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "We are the queen's abjects, and must obey."}
{"text": "Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;"}
{"text": "And whatsoever you will employ me in,"}
{"text": "Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,"}
{"text": "I will perform it to enfranchise you."}
{"text": "Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood"}
{"text": "Touches me deeper than you can imagine."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "I know it pleaseth neither of us well."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;"}
{"text": "Meantime, have patience."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "I must perforce. Farewell."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return."}
{"text": "Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,"}
{"text": "That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,"}
{"text": "If heaven will take the present at our hands."}
{"text": "But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Good time of day unto my gracious lord!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "As much unto my good lord chamberlain!"}
{"text": "Well are you welcome to the open air."}
{"text": "How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:"}
{"text": "But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks"}
{"text": "That were the cause of my imprisonment."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;"}
{"text": "For they that were your enemies are his,"}
{"text": "And have prevail'd as much on him as you."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,"}
{"text": "While kites and buzzards prey at liberty."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What news abroad?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "No news so bad abroad as this at home;"}
{"text": "The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,"}
{"text": "And his physicians fear him mightily."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed."}
{"text": "O, he hath kept an evil diet long,"}
{"text": "And overmuch consumed his royal person:"}
{"text": "'Tis very grievous to be thought upon."}
{"text": "What, is he in his bed?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "He is."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Go you before, and I will follow you."}
{"text": "He cannot live, I hope; and must not die"}
{"text": "Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven."}
{"text": "I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,"}
{"text": "With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;"}
{"text": "And, if I fall not in my deep intent,"}
{"text": "Clarence hath not another day to live:"}
{"text": "Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,"}
{"text": "And leave the world for me to bustle in!"}
{"text": "For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter."}
{"text": "What though I kill'd her husband and her father?"}
{"text": "The readiest way to make the wench amends"}
{"text": "Is to become her husband and her father:"}
{"text": "The which will I; not all so much for love"}
{"text": "As for another secret close intent,"}
{"text": "By marrying her which I must reach unto."}
{"text": "But yet I run before my horse to market:"}
{"text": "Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:"}
{"text": "When they are gone, then must I count my gains."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Set down, set down your honourable load,"}
{"text": "If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,"}
{"text": "Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament"}
{"text": "The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster."}
{"text": "Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!"}
{"text": "Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!"}
{"text": "Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!"}
{"text": "Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,"}
{"text": "To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,"}
{"text": "Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,"}
{"text": "Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!"}
{"text": "Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,"}
{"text": "I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes."}
{"text": "Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!"}
{"text": "Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!"}
{"text": "Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!"}
{"text": "More direful hap betide that hated wretch,"}
{"text": "That makes us wretched by the death of thee,"}
{"text": "Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,"}
{"text": "Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!"}
{"text": "If ever he have child, abortive be it,"}
{"text": "Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,"}
{"text": "Whose ugly and unnatural aspect"}
{"text": "May fright the hopeful mother at the view;"}
{"text": "And that be heir to his unhappiness!"}
{"text": "If ever he have wife, let her he made"}
{"text": "A miserable by the death of him"}
{"text": "As I am made by my poor lord and thee!"}
{"text": "Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,"}
{"text": "Taken from Paul's to be interred there;"}
{"text": "And still, as you are weary of the weight,"}
{"text": "Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "What black magician conjures up this fiend,"}
{"text": "To stop devoted charitable deeds?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,"}
{"text": "I'll make a corse of him that disobeys."}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:"}
{"text": "Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,"}
{"text": "Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,"}
{"text": "And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?"}
{"text": "Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,"}
{"text": "And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil."}
{"text": "Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!"}
{"text": "Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,"}
{"text": "His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;"}
{"text": "For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,"}
{"text": "Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims."}
{"text": "If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,"}
{"text": "Behold this pattern of thy butcheries."}
{"text": "O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds"}
{"text": "Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!"}
{"text": "Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;"}
{"text": "For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood"}
{"text": "From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;"}
{"text": "Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,"}
{"text": "Provokes this deluge most unnatural."}
{"text": "O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!"}
{"text": "O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!"}
{"text": "Either heaven with lightning strike the"}
{"text": "murderer dead,"}
{"text": "Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,"}
{"text": "As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood"}
{"text": "Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Lady, you know no rules of charity,"}
{"text": "Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:"}
{"text": "No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "But I know none, and therefore am no beast."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "More wonderful, when angels are so angry."}
{"text": "Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,"}
{"text": "Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,"}
{"text": "By circumstance, but to acquit myself."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,"}
{"text": "For these known evils, but to give me leave,"}
{"text": "By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have"}
{"text": "Some patient leisure to excuse myself."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make"}
{"text": "No excuse current, but to hang thyself."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "By such despair, I should accuse myself."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;"}
{"text": "For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,"}
{"text": "Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Say that I slew them not?"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Why, then they are not dead:"}
{"text": "But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I did not kill your husband."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Why, then he is alive."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw"}
{"text": "Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;"}
{"text": "The which thou once didst bend against her breast,"}
{"text": "But that thy brothers beat aside the point."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,"}
{"text": "which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind."}
{"text": "Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:"}
{"text": "Didst thou not kill this king?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I grant ye."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too"}
{"text": "Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!"}
{"text": "O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;"}
{"text": "For he was fitter for that place than earth."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "And thou unfit for any place but hell."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Some dungeon."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Your bed-chamber."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "So will it, madam till I lie with you."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I hope so."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,"}
{"text": "To leave this keen encounter of our wits,"}
{"text": "And fall somewhat into a slower method,"}
{"text": "Is not the causer of the timeless deaths"}
{"text": "Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,"}
{"text": "As blameful as the executioner?"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Your beauty was the cause of that effect;"}
{"text": "Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep"}
{"text": "To undertake the death of all the world,"}
{"text": "So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,"}
{"text": "These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;"}
{"text": "You should not blemish it, if I stood by:"}
{"text": "As all the world is cheered by the sun,"}
{"text": "So I by that; it is my day, my life."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I would I were, to be revenged on thee."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "It is a quarrel most unnatural,"}
{"text": "To be revenged on him that loveth you."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "It is a quarrel just and reasonable,"}
{"text": "To be revenged on him that slew my husband."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,"}
{"text": "Did it to help thee to a better husband."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "His better doth not breathe upon the earth."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "He lives that loves thee better than he could."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Name him."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Plantagenet."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Why, that was he."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "The selfsame name, but one of better nature."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Where is he?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Here."}
{"text": "Why dost thou spit at me?"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Never came poison from so sweet a place."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Never hung poison on a fouler toad."}
{"text": "Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I would they were, that I might die at once;"}
{"text": "For now they kill me with a living death."}
{"text": "Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,"}
{"text": "Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:"}
{"text": "These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,"}
{"text": "No, when my father York and Edward wept,"}
{"text": "To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made"}
{"text": "When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;"}
{"text": "Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,"}
{"text": "Told the sad story of my father's death,"}
{"text": "And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,"}
{"text": "That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks"}
{"text": "Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time"}
{"text": "My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;"}
{"text": "And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,"}
{"text": "Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping."}
{"text": "I never sued to friend nor enemy;"}
{"text": "My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;"}
{"text": "But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,"}
{"text": "My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak."}
{"text": "Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made"}
{"text": "For kissing, lady, not for such contempt."}
{"text": "If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,"}
{"text": "Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;"}
{"text": "Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom."}
{"text": "And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,"}
{"text": "I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,"}
{"text": "And humbly beg the death upon my knee."}
{"text": "Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,"}
{"text": "But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me."}
{"text": "Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,"}
{"text": "But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on."}
{"text": "Take up the sword again, or take up me."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,"}
{"text": "I will not be the executioner."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I have already."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Tush, that was in thy rage:"}
{"text": "Speak it again, and, even with the word,"}
{"text": "That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,"}
{"text": "Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;"}
{"text": "To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I would I knew thy heart."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "'Tis figured in my tongue."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "I fear me both are false."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Then never man was true."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Well, well, put up your sword."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Say, then, my peace is made."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "That shall you know hereafter."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "But shall I live in hope?"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "All men, I hope, live so."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Vouchsafe to wear this ring."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "To take is not to give."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Look, how this ring encompasseth finger."}
{"text": "Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;"}
{"text": "Wear both of them, for both of them are thine."}
{"text": "And if thy poor devoted suppliant may"}
{"text": "But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,"}
{"text": "Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "What is it?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "That it would please thee leave these sad designs"}
{"text": "To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,"}
{"text": "And presently repair to Crosby Place;"}
{"text": "Where, after I have solemnly interr'd"}
{"text": "At Chertsey monastery this noble king,"}
{"text": "And wet his grave with my repentant tears,"}
{"text": "I will with all expedient duty see you:"}
{"text": "For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,"}
{"text": "Grant me this boon."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "With all my heart; and much it joys me too,"}
{"text": "To see you are become so penitent."}
{"text": "Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Bid me farewell."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "'Tis more than you deserve;"}
{"text": "But since you teach me how to flatter you,"}
{"text": "Imagine I have said farewell already."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Sirs, take up the corse."}
{"text": "GENTLEMEN:"}
{"text": "Towards Chertsey, noble lord?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining."}
{"text": "Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?"}
{"text": "Was ever woman in this humour won?"}
{"text": "I'll have her; but I will not keep her long."}
{"text": "What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,"}
{"text": "To take her in her heart's extremest hate,"}
{"text": "With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,"}
{"text": "The bleeding witness of her hatred by;"}
{"text": "Having God, her conscience, and these bars"}

{"text": "Hath she forgot already that brave prince,"}
{"text": "Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,"}
{"text": "Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?"}
{"text": "A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,"}
{"text": "Framed in the prodigality of nature,"}
{"text": "Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,"}
{"text": "The spacious world cannot again afford"}
{"text": "And will she yet debase her eyes on me,"}
{"text": "That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,"}
{"text": "And made her widow to a woful bed?"}
{"text": "On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?"}
{"text": "On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?"}
{"text": "My dukedom to a beggarly denier,"}
{"text": "I do mistake my person all this while:"}
{"text": "Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,"}
{"text": "Myself to be a marvellous proper man."}
{"text": "I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,"}
{"text": "And entertain some score or two of tailors,"}
{"text": "To study fashions to adorn my body:"}
{"text": "Since I am crept in favour with myself,"}
{"text": "Will maintain it with some little cost."}
{"text": "But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;"}
{"text": "And then return lamenting to my love."}
{"text": "Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,"}
{"text": "That I may see my shadow as I pass."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty"}
{"text": "Will soon recover his accustom'd health."}
{"text": "GREY:"}
{"text": "In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:"}
{"text": "Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,"}
{"text": "And cheer his grace with quick and merry words."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "If he were dead, what would betide of me?"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "No other harm but loss of such a lord."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "The loss of such a lord includes all harm."}
{"text": "GREY:"}
{"text": "The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,"}
{"text": "To be your comforter when he is gone."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Oh, he is young and his minority"}
{"text": "Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,"}
{"text": "A man that loves not me, nor none of you."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Is it concluded that he shall be protector?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "It is determined, not concluded yet:"}
{"text": "But so it must be, if the king miscarry."}
{"text": "GREY:"}
{"text": "Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Good time of day unto your royal grace!"}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "God make your majesty joyful as you have been!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby."}
{"text": "To your good prayers will scarcely say amen."}
{"text": "Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,"}
{"text": "And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured"}
{"text": "I hate not you for her proud arrogance."}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "I do beseech you, either not believe"}
{"text": "The envious slanders of her false accusers;"}
{"text": "Or, if she be accused in true report,"}
{"text": "Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds"}
{"text": "From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?"}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "But now the Duke of Buckingham and I"}
{"text": "Are come from visiting his majesty."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "What likelihood of his amendment, lords?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "God grant him health! Did you confer with him?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement"}
{"text": "Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,"}
{"text": "And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;"}
{"text": "And sent to warn them to his royal presence."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Would all were well! but that will never be"}
{"text": "I fear our happiness is at the highest."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:"}
{"text": "Who are they that complain unto the king,"}
{"text": "That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?"}
{"text": "By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly"}
{"text": "That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours."}
{"text": "Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,"}
{"text": "Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,"}
{"text": "Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,"}
{"text": "I must be held a rancorous enemy."}
{"text": "Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,"}
{"text": "But thus his simple truth must be abused"}
{"text": "By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace."}
{"text": "When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?"}
{"text": "Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?"}
{"text": "A plague upon you all! His royal person,--"}
{"text": "Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--"}
{"text": "Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,"}
{"text": "But you must trouble him with lewd complaints."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter."}
{"text": "The king, of his own royal disposition,"}
{"text": "And not provoked by any suitor else;"}
{"text": "Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,"}
{"text": "Which in your outward actions shows itself"}
{"text": "Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,"}
{"text": "Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather"}
{"text": "The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,"}
{"text": "That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:"}
{"text": "Since every Jack became a gentleman"}
{"text": "There's many a gentle person made a Jack."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Come, come, we know your meaning, brother"}
{"text": "Gloucester;"}
{"text": "You envy my advancement and my friends':"}
{"text": "God grant we never may have need of you!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:"}
{"text": "Your brother is imprison'd by your means,"}
{"text": "Myself disgraced, and the nobility"}
{"text": "Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions"}
{"text": "Are daily given to ennoble those"}
{"text": "That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "By Him that raised me to this careful height"}
{"text": "From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,"}
{"text": "I never did incense his majesty"}
{"text": "Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been"}
{"text": "An earnest advocate to plead for him."}
{"text": "My lord, you do me shameful injury,"}
{"text": "Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "You may deny that you were not the cause"}
{"text": "Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "She may, my lord, for--"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?"}
{"text": "She may do more, sir, than denying that:"}
{"text": "She may help you to many fair preferments,"}
{"text": "And then deny her aiding hand therein,"}
{"text": "And lay those honours on your high deserts."}
{"text": "What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "What, marry, may she?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What, marry, may she! marry with a king,"}
{"text": "A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:"}
{"text": "I wis your grandam had a worser match."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne"}
{"text": "Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:"}
{"text": "By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty"}
{"text": "With those gross taunts I often have endured."}
{"text": "I had rather be a country servant-maid"}
{"text": "Than a great queen, with this condition,"}
{"text": "To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:"}
{"text": "Small joy have I in being England's queen."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!"}
{"text": "Thy honour, state and seat is due to me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What! threat you me with telling of the king?"}
{"text": "Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said"}
{"text": "I will avouch in presence of the king:"}
{"text": "I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower."}
{"text": "'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Out, devil! I remember them too well:"}
{"text": "Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,"}
{"text": "And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,"}
{"text": "I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;"}
{"text": "A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,"}
{"text": "A liberal rewarder of his friends:"}
{"text": "To royalize his blood I spilt mine own."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Yea, and much better blood than his or thine."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "In all which time you and your husband Grey"}
{"text": "Were factious for the house of Lancaster;"}
{"text": "And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband"}
{"text": "In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?"}
{"text": "Let me put in your minds, if you forget,"}
{"text": "What you have been ere now, and what you are;"}
{"text": "Withal, what I have been, and what I am."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "A murderous villain, and so still thou art."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;"}
{"text": "Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Which God revenge!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "To fight on Edward's party for the crown;"}
{"text": "And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up."}
{"text": "I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;"}
{"text": "Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine"}
{"text": "I am too childish-foolish for this world."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,"}
{"text": "Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days"}
{"text": "Which here you urge to prove us enemies,"}
{"text": "We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:"}
{"text": "So should we you, if you should be our king."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:"}
{"text": "Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "As little joy, my lord, as you suppose"}
{"text": "You should enjoy, were you this country's king,"}
{"text": "As little joy may you suppose in me."}
{"text": "That I enjoy, being the queen thereof."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;"}
{"text": "For I am she, and altogether joyless."}
{"text": "I can no longer hold me patient."}
{"text": "Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out"}
{"text": "In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!"}
{"text": "Which of you trembles not that looks on me?"}
{"text": "If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,"}
{"text": "Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?"}
{"text": "O gentle villain, do not turn away!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;"}
{"text": "That will I make before I let thee go."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Wert thou not banished on pain of death?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "I was; but I do find more pain in banishment"}
{"text": "Than death can yield me here by my abode."}
{"text": "A husband and a son thou owest to me;"}
{"text": "And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:"}
{"text": "The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,"}
{"text": "And all the pleasures you usurp are mine."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "The curse my noble father laid on thee,"}
{"text": "When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper"}
{"text": "And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,"}
{"text": "And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout"}
{"text": "Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--"}
{"text": "His curses, then from bitterness of soul"}
{"text": "Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;"}
{"text": "And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "So just is God, to right the innocent."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,"}
{"text": "And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "No man but prophesied revenge for it."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Northumberland, then present, wept to see it."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "What were you snarling all before I came,"}
{"text": "Ready to catch each other by the throat,"}
{"text": "And turn you all your hatred now on me?"}
{"text": "Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?"}
{"text": "That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,"}
{"text": "Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,"}
{"text": "Could all but answer for that peevish brat?"}
{"text": "Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?"}
{"text": "Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!"}
{"text": "If not by war, by surfeit die your king,"}
{"text": "As ours by murder, to make him a king!"}
{"text": "Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,"}
{"text": "For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,"}
{"text": "Die in his youth by like untimely violence!"}
{"text": "Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,"}
{"text": "Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!"}
{"text": "Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;"}
{"text": "And see another, as I see thee now,"}
{"text": "Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!"}
{"text": "Long die thy happy days before thy death;"}
{"text": "And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,"}
{"text": "Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!"}
{"text": "Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,"}
{"text": "And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son"}
{"text": "Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,"}
{"text": "That none of you may live your natural age,"}
{"text": "But by some unlook'd accident cut off!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}

{"text": "If heaven have any grievous plague in store"}
{"text": "Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,"}
{"text": "O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,"}
{"text": "And then hurl down their indignation"}
{"text": "On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!"}
{"text": "The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!"}
{"text": "Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,"}
{"text": "And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!"}
{"text": "No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,"}
{"text": "Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream"}
{"text": "Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!"}
{"text": "Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!"}

{"text": "The time will come when thou shalt wish for me"}

{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,"}

{"text": "Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:"}
{"text": "Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current."}
{"text": "O, that your young nobility could judge"}
{"text": "What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!"}

{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,"}
{"text": "Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,"}
{"text": "And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!"}
{"text": "Witness my son, now in the shade of death;"}
{"text": "Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath"}

{"text": "I do beweep to many simple gulls"}
{"text": "Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;"}
{"text": "And say it is the queen and her allies"}
{"text": "That stir the king against the duke my brother."}
{"text": "Now, they believe it; and withal whet me"}
{"text": "To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:"}
{"text": "But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,"}
{"text": "Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:"}
{"text": "And thus I clothe my naked villany"}

{"text": "First Murderer:"}

{"text": "When you have done, repair to Crosby Place."}
{"text": "But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,"}
{"text": "Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;"}

{"text": "That had befall'n us. As we paced along"}
{"text": "Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,"}
{"text": "Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,"}
{"text": "Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,"}
{"text": "Into the tumbling billows of the main."}
{"text": "Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!"}
{"text": "What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!"}
{"text": "What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!"}
{"text": "Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;"}
{"text": "Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;"}
{"text": "Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,"}
{"text": "Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,"}
{"text": "All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:"}
{"text": "Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes"}
{"text": "Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,"}
{"text": "As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,"}
{"text": "Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,"}
{"text": "And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "Had you such leisure in the time of death"}
{"text": "To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Methought I had; and often did I strive"}
{"text": "To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood"}
{"text": "Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth"}
{"text": "To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;"}
{"text": "But smother'd it within my panting bulk,"}
{"text": "Which almost burst to belch it in the sea."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "Awaked you not with this sore agony?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;"}
{"text": "O, then began the tempest to my soul,"}
{"text": "Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,"}
{"text": "With that grim ferryman which poets write of,"}
{"text": "Unto the kingdom of perpetual night."}
{"text": "The first that there did greet my stranger soul,"}
{"text": "Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;"}
{"text": "Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury"}
{"text": "Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'"}
{"text": "And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by"}
{"text": "A shadow like an angel, with bright hair"}
{"text": "Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,"}
{"text": "'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,"}
{"text": "That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;"}
{"text": "Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'"}
{"text": "With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends"}
{"text": "Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears"}
{"text": "Such hideous cries, that with the very noise"}
{"text": "I trembling waked, and for a season after"}
{"text": "Could not believe but that I was in hell,"}
{"text": "Such terrible impression made the dream."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;"}
{"text": "I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "O Brakenbury, I have done those things,"}
{"text": "Which now bear evidence against my soul,"}
{"text": "For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!"}
{"text": "O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,"}
{"text": "But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,"}
{"text": "Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,"}
{"text": "O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!"}
{"text": "I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;"}
{"text": "My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!"}
{"text": "Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,"}
{"text": "Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night."}
{"text": "Princes have but their tides for their glories,"}
{"text": "An outward honour for an inward toil;"}
{"text": "And, for unfelt imagination,"}
{"text": "They often feel a world of restless cares:"}
{"text": "So that, betwixt their tides and low names,"}
{"text": "There's nothing differs but the outward fame."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Ho! who's here?"}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?"}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "Yea, are you so brief?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show"}
{"text": "him our commission; talk no more."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "I am, in this, commanded to deliver"}
{"text": "The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:"}
{"text": "I will not reason what is meant hereby,"}
{"text": "Because I will be guiltless of the meaning."}
{"text": "Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:"}
{"text": "I'll to the king; and signify to him"}
{"text": "That thus I have resign'd my charge to you."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?"}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till"}
{"text": "the judgment-day."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind"}
{"text": "of remorse in me."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "What, art thou afraid?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be"}
{"text": "damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "I thought thou hadst been resolute."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "So I am, to let him live."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour"}
{"text": "will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one"}
{"text": "would tell twenty."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "How dost thou feel thyself now?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet"}
{"text": "within me."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Remember our reward, when the deed is done."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Where is thy conscience now?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "In the Duke of Gloucester's purse."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,"}
{"text": "thy conscience flies out."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "How if it come to thee again?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it"}
{"text": "makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it"}
{"text": "accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;"}
{"text": "he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it"}
{"text": "detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that"}
{"text": "mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of"}
{"text": "obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold"}
{"text": "that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it"}
{"text": "is turned out of all towns and cities for a"}
{"text": "dangerous thing; and every man that means to live"}
{"text": "well endeavours to trust to himself and to live"}
{"text": "without it."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me"}
{"text": "not to kill the duke."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he"}
{"text": "would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,"}
{"text": "I warrant thee."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his"}
{"text": "reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?"}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy"}
{"text": "sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt"}
{"text": "in the next room."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "O excellent devise! make a sop of him."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "No, first let's reason with him."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine."}
{"text": "Second murderer:"}
{"text": "You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "In God's name, what art thou?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "A man, as you are."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "But not, as I am, royal."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Nor you, as we are, loyal."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!"}
{"text": "Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?"}
{"text": "Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?"}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "To, to, to--"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "To murder me?"}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "Ay, ay."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,"}
{"text": "And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it."}
{"text": "Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?"}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Offended us you have not, but the king."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "I shall be reconciled to him again."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Are you call'd forth from out a world of men"}
{"text": "To slay the innocent? What is my offence?"}
{"text": "Where are the evidence that do accuse me?"}
{"text": "What lawful quest have given their verdict up"}
{"text": "Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced"}
{"text": "The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?"}
{"text": "Before I be convict by course of law,"}
{"text": "To threaten me with death is most unlawful."}
{"text": "I charge you, as you hope to have redemption"}
{"text": "By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,"}
{"text": "That you depart and lay no hands on me"}
{"text": "The deed you undertake is damnable."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "What we will do, we do upon command."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "And he that hath commanded is the king."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings"}
{"text": "Hath in the tables of his law commanded"}
{"text": "That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,"}
{"text": "Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?"}
{"text": "Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,"}
{"text": "To hurl upon their heads that break his law."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,"}
{"text": "For false forswearing and for murder too:"}
{"text": "Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,"}
{"text": "To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "And, like a traitor to the name of God,"}
{"text": "Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade"}
{"text": "Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,"}
{"text": "When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?"}
{"text": "For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,"}
{"text": "He sends ye not to murder me for this"}
{"text": "For in this sin he is as deep as I."}
{"text": "If God will be revenged for this deed."}
{"text": "O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,"}
{"text": "Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;"}
{"text": "He needs no indirect nor lawless course"}
{"text": "To cut off those that have offended him."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,"}
{"text": "When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,"}
{"text": "That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "My brother's love, the devil, and my rage."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,"}
{"text": "Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;"}
{"text": "I am his brother, and I love him well."}
{"text": "If you be hired for meed, go back again,"}
{"text": "And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,"}
{"text": "Who shall reward you better for my life"}
{"text": "Than Edward will for tidings of my death."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:"}
{"text": "Go you to him from me."}
{"text": "Both:"}
{"text": "Ay, so we will."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Tell him, when that our princely father York"}
{"text": "Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,"}
{"text": "And charged us from his soul to love each other,"}
{"text": "He little thought of this divided friendship:"}
{"text": "Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "O, do not slander him, for he is kind."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Right,"}
{"text": "As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:"}
{"text": "'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "It cannot be; for when I parted with him,"}
{"text": "He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,"}
{"text": "That he would labour my delivery."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee"}
{"text": "From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,"}
{"text": "To counsel me to make my peace with God,"}
{"text": "And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,"}
{"text": "That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?"}
{"text": "Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on"}
{"text": "To do this deed will hate you for the deed."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "What shall we do?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Relent, and save your souls."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish."}
{"text": "Which of you, if you were a prince's son,"}
{"text": "Being pent from liberty, as I am now,"}
{"text": "if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,"}
{"text": "Would not entreat for life?"}
{"text": "My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:"}
{"text": "O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,"}
{"text": "Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,"}
{"text": "As you would beg, were you in my distress"}
{"text": "A begging prince what beggar pities not?"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "Look behind you, my lord."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "Take that, and that: if all this will not do,"}
{"text": "I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within."}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!"}
{"text": "How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands"}
{"text": "Of this most grievous guilty murder done!"}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?"}
{"text": "By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!"}
{"text": "Second Murderer:"}
{"text": "I would he knew that I had saved his brother!"}
{"text": "Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;"}
{"text": "For I repent me that the duke is slain."}
{"text": "First Murderer:"}
{"text": "So do not I: go, coward as thou art."}
{"text": "Now must I hide his body in some hole,"}
{"text": "Until the duke take order for his burial:"}
{"text": "And when I have my meed, I must away;"}
{"text": "For this will out, and here I must not stay."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:"}
{"text": "You peers, continue this united league:"}
{"text": "I every day expect an embassage"}
{"text": "From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;"}
{"text": "And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,"}
{"text": "Since I have set my friends at peace on earth."}
{"text": "Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;"}
{"text": "Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:"}
{"text": "And with my hand I seal my true heart's love."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Take heed you dally not before your king;"}
{"text": "Lest he that is the supreme King of kings"}
{"text": "Confound your hidden falsehood, and award"}
{"text": "Either of you to be the other's end."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,"}
{"text": "Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;"}
{"text": "You have been factious one against the other,"}
{"text": "Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;"}
{"text": "And what you do, do it unfeignedly."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Here, Hastings; I will never more remember"}
{"text": "Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "This interchange of love, I here protest,"}
{"text": "Upon my part shall be unviolable."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "And so swear I, my lord"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league"}
{"text": "With thy embracements to my wife's allies,"}
{"text": "And make me happy in your unity."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate"}
{"text": "On you or yours,"}
{"text": "but with all duteous love"}
{"text": "Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me"}
{"text": "With hate in those where I expect most love!"}
{"text": "When I have most need to employ a friend,"}
{"text": "And most assured that he is a friend"}
{"text": "Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,"}
{"text": "Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,"}
{"text": "When I am cold in zeal to yours."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,"}
{"text": "is this thy vow unto my sickly heart."}
{"text": "There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,"}
{"text": "To make the perfect period of this peace."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "And, in good time, here comes the noble duke."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:"}
{"text": "And, princely peers, a happy time of day!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day."}
{"text": "Brother, we done deeds of charity;"}
{"text": "Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,"}
{"text": "Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:"}
{"text": "Amongst this princely heap, if any here,"}
{"text": "By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,"}
{"text": "Hold me a foe;"}
{"text": "If I unwittingly, or in my rage,"}
{"text": "Have aught committed that is hardly borne"}
{"text": "By any in this presence, I desire"}
{"text": "To reconcile me to his friendly peace:"}
{"text": "'Tis death to me to be at enmity;"}
{"text": "I hate it, and desire all good men's love."}
{"text": "First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,"}
{"text": "Which I will purchase with my duteous service;"}
{"text": "Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,"}
{"text": "If ever any grudge were lodged between us;"}
{"text": "Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;"}
{"text": "That without desert have frown'd on me;"}
{"text": "Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all."}
{"text": "I do not know that Englishman alive"}
{"text": "With whom my soul is any jot at odds"}
{"text": "More than the infant that is born to-night"}
{"text": "I thank my God for my humility."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:"}
{"text": "I would to God all strifes were well compounded."}
{"text": "My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty"}
{"text": "To take our brother Clarence to your grace."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this"}
{"text": "To be so bouted in this royal presence?"}
{"text": "Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?"}
{"text": "You do him injury to scorn his corse."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "All seeing heaven, what a world is this!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?"}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence"}
{"text": "But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "But he, poor soul, by your first order died,"}
{"text": "And that a winged Mercury did bear:"}
{"text": "Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,"}
{"text": "That came too lag to see him buried."}
{"text": "God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,"}
{"text": "Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,"}
{"text": "Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,"}
{"text": "And yet go current from suspicion!"}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "I will not rise, unless your highness grant."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;"}
{"text": "Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman"}
{"text": "Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,"}
{"text": "And shall the same give pardon to a slave?"}
{"text": "My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,"}
{"text": "And yet his punishment was cruel death."}
{"text": "Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,"}
{"text": "Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised"}
{"text": "Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?"}
{"text": "Who told me how the poor soul did forsake"}
{"text": "The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?"}
{"text": "Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury"}
{"text": "When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,"}
{"text": "And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?"}
{"text": "Who told me, when we both lay in the field"}
{"text": "Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me"}
{"text": "Even in his own garments, and gave himself,"}
{"text": "All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?"}
{"text": "All this from my remembrance brutish wrath"}
{"text": "Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you"}
{"text": "Had so much grace to put it in my mind."}
{"text": "But when your carters or your waiting-vassals"}
{"text": "Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced"}
{"text": "The precious image of our dear Redeemer,"}
{"text": "You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;"}
{"text": "And I unjustly too, must grant it you"}
{"text": "But for my brother not a man would speak,"}
{"text": "Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself"}
{"text": "For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all"}
{"text": "Have been beholding to him in his life;"}
{"text": "Yet none of you would once plead for his life."}
{"text": "O God, I fear thy justice will take hold"}
{"text": "On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!"}
{"text": "Come, Hastings, help me to my closet."}
{"text": "Oh, poor Clarence!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not"}
{"text": "How that the guilty kindred of the queen"}
{"text": "Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?"}
{"text": "O, they did urge it still unto the king!"}
{"text": "God will revenge it. But come, let us in,"}
{"text": "To comfort Edward with our company."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "We wait upon your grace."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "No, boy."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,"}
{"text": "And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'"}
{"text": "Girl:"}
{"text": "Why do you look on us, and shake your head,"}
{"text": "And call us wretches, orphans, castaways"}
{"text": "If that our noble father be alive?"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;"}
{"text": "I do lament the sickness of the king."}
{"text": "As loath to lose him, not your father's death;"}
{"text": "It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead."}
{"text": "The king my uncle is to blame for this:"}
{"text": "God will revenge it; whom I will importune"}
{"text": "With daily prayers all to that effect."}
{"text": "Girl:"}
{"text": "And so will I."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:"}
{"text": "Incapable and shallow innocents,"}
{"text": "You cannot guess who caused your father's death."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester"}
{"text": "Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,"}
{"text": "Devised impeachments to imprison him :"}
{"text": "And when my uncle told me so, he wept,"}
{"text": "And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;"}
{"text": "Bade me rely on him as on my father,"}
{"text": "And he would love me dearly as his child."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,"}
{"text": "And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!"}
{"text": "He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;"}
{"text": "Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Ay, boy."}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,"}
{"text": "To chide my fortune, and torment myself?"}
{"text": "I'll join with black despair against my soul,"}
{"text": "And to myself become an enemy."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "What means this scene of rude impatience?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "To make an act of tragic violence:"}
{"text": "Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead."}
{"text": "Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?"}
{"text": "Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?"}
{"text": "If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,"}
{"text": "That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;"}
{"text": "Or, like obedient subjects, follow him"}
{"text": "To his new kingdom of perpetual rest."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow"}
{"text": "As I had title in thy noble husband!"}
{"text": "I have bewept a worthy husband's death,"}
{"text": "And lived by looking on his images:"}
{"text": "But now two mirrors of his princely semblance"}
{"text": "Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,"}
{"text": "And I for comfort have but one false glass,"}
{"text": "Which grieves me when I see my shame in him."}
{"text": "Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,"}
{"text": "And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:"}
{"text": "But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,"}
{"text": "And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,"}
{"text": "Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,"}
{"text": "Thine being but a moiety of my grief,"}
{"text": "To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!"}
{"text": "Boy:"}
{"text": "Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;"}
{"text": "How can we aid you with our kindred tears?"}
{"text": "Girl:"}
{"text": "Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;"}
{"text": "Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Give me no help in lamentation;"}
{"text": "I am not barren to bring forth complaints"}
{"text": "All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,"}
{"text": "That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,"}
{"text": "May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!"}
{"text": "Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!"}
{"text": "Children:"}
{"text": "Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone."}
{"text": "Children:"}
{"text": "What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "What stays had I but they? and they are gone."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Was never widow had so dear a loss!"}
{"text": "Children:"}
{"text": "Were never orphans had so dear a loss!"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Was never mother had so dear a loss!"}
{"text": "Alas, I am the mother of these moans!"}
{"text": "Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general."}
{"text": "She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;"}
{"text": "I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:"}
{"text": "These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;"}
{"text": "I for an Edward weep, so do not they:"}
{"text": "Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,"}
{"text": "Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,"}
{"text": "And I will pamper it with lamentations."}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased"}
{"text": "That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:"}
{"text": "In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,"}
{"text": "With dull unwilligness to repay a debt"}
{"text": "Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;"}
{"text": "Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,"}
{"text": "For it requires the royal debt it lent you."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,"}
{"text": "Of the young prince your son: send straight for him"}
{"text": "Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:"}
{"text": "Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,"}
{"text": "And plant your joys in living Edward's throne."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause"}
{"text": "To wail the dimming of our shining star;"}
{"text": "But none can cure their harms by wailing them."}
{"text": "Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;"}
{"text": "I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee"}
{"text": "I crave your blessing."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,"}

{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,"}
{"text": "That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,"}
{"text": "Now cheer each other in each other's love"}
{"text": "Though we have spent our harvest of this king,"}
{"text": "We are to reap the harvest of his son."}
{"text": "The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,"}
{"text": "But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,"}
{"text": "Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:"}
{"text": "Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,"}
{"text": "Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd"}
{"text": "Hither to London, to be crown'd our king."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,"}
{"text": "The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,"}
{"text": "Which would be so much the more dangerous"}
{"text": "By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:"}
{"text": "Where every horse bears his commanding rein,"}
{"text": "And may direct his course as please himself,"}
{"text": "As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,"}
{"text": "In my opinion, ought to be prevented."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I hope the king made peace with all of us"}
{"text": "And the compact is firm and true in me."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "And so in me; and so, I think, in all:"}
{"text": "Yet, since it is but green, it should be put"}
{"text": "To no apparent likelihood of breach,"}
{"text": "Which haply by much company might be urged:"}
{"text": "Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,"}
{"text": "That it is meet so few should fetch the prince."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "And so say I."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Then be it so; and go we to determine"}
{"text": "Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow."}
{"text": "Madam, and you, my mother, will you go"}
{"text": "To give your censures in this weighty business?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "With all our harts."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,"}
{"text": "For God's sake, let not us two be behind;"}
{"text": "For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,"}
{"text": "As index to the story we late talk'd of,"}
{"text": "To part the queen's proud kindred from the king."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My other self, my counsel's consistory,"}
{"text": "My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,"}
{"text": "I, like a child, will go by thy direction."}
{"text": "Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "I promise you, I scarcely know myself:"}
{"text": "Hear you the news abroad?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Ay, that the king is dead."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:"}
{"text": "I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Neighbours, God speed!"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Give you good morrow, sir."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!"}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Then, masters, look to see a troublous world."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "In him there is a hope of government,"}
{"text": "That in his nonage council under him,"}
{"text": "And in his full and ripen'd years himself,"}
{"text": "No doubt, shall then and till then govern well."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "So stood the state when Henry the Sixth"}
{"text": "Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;"}
{"text": "For then this land was famously enrich'd"}
{"text": "With politic grave counsel; then the king"}
{"text": "Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Better it were they all came by the father,"}
{"text": "Or by the father there were none at all;"}
{"text": "For emulation now, who shall be nearest,"}
{"text": "Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not."}
{"text": "O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!"}
{"text": "And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:"}
{"text": "And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,"}
{"text": "This sickly land might solace as before."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;"}
{"text": "When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;"}
{"text": "When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?"}
{"text": "Untimely storms make men expect a dearth."}
{"text": "All may be well; but, if God sort it so,"}
{"text": "'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect."}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:"}
{"text": "Ye cannot reason almost with a man"}
{"text": "That looks not heavily and full of fear."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "Before the times of change, still is it so:"}
{"text": "By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust"}
{"text": "Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see"}
{"text": "The waters swell before a boisterous storm."}
{"text": "But leave it all to God. whither away?"}
{"text": "Second Citizen:"}
{"text": "Marry, we were sent for to the justices."}
{"text": "Third Citizen:"}
{"text": "And so was I: I'll bear you company."}
{"text": "ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;"}
{"text": "At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:"}
{"text": "To-morrow, or next day, they will be here."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I long with all my heart to see the prince:"}
{"text": "I hope he is much grown since last I saw him."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "But I hear, no; they say my son of York"}
{"text": "Hath almost overta'en him in his growth."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Ay, mother; but I would not have it so."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,"}
{"text": "My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow"}
{"text": "More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle"}
{"text": "Gloucester,"}
{"text": "'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'"}
{"text": "And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,"}
{"text": "Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold"}
{"text": "In him that did object the same to thee;"}
{"text": "He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,"}
{"text": "So long a-growing and so leisurely,"}
{"text": "That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious."}
{"text": "ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,"}
{"text": "I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,"}
{"text": "To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast"}
{"text": "That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old"}
{"text": "'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth."}
{"text": "Grandam, this would have been a biting jest."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Grandam, his nurse."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd."}
{"text": "ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Good madam, be not angry with the child."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Pitchers have ears."}
{"text": "ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Here comes a messenger. What news?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "How fares the prince?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Well, madam, and in health."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "What is thy news then?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,"}
{"text": "With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Who hath committed them?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The mighty dukes"}
{"text": "Gloucester and Buckingham."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "For what offence?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;"}
{"text": "Why or for what these nobles were committed"}
{"text": "Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!"}
{"text": "The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;"}
{"text": "Insulting tyranny begins to jet"}
{"text": "Upon the innocent and aweless throne:"}
{"text": "Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!"}
{"text": "I see, as in a map, the end of all."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,"}
{"text": "How many of you have mine eyes beheld!"}
{"text": "My husband lost his life to get the crown;"}
{"text": "And often up and down my sons were toss'd,"}
{"text": "For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:"}
{"text": "And being seated, and domestic broils"}
{"text": "Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors."}
{"text": "Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,"}
{"text": "Self against self: O, preposterous"}
{"text": "And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;"}
{"text": "Or let me die, to look on death no more!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary."}
{"text": "Madam, farewell."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I'll go along with you."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "You have no cause."}
{"text": "ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:"}
{"text": "My gracious lady, go;"}
{"text": "And thither bear your treasure and your goods."}
{"text": "For my part, I'll resign unto your grace"}
{"text": "The seal I keep: and so betide to me"}
{"text": "As well I tender you and all of yours!"}
{"text": "Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign"}
{"text": "The weary way hath made you melancholy."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "No, uncle; but our crosses on the way"}
{"text": "Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy"}
{"text": "I want more uncles here to welcome me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years"}
{"text": "Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit"}
{"text": "Nor more can you distinguish of a man"}
{"text": "Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,"}
{"text": "Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart."}
{"text": "Those uncles which you want were dangerous;"}
{"text": "Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,"}
{"text": "But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :"}
{"text": "God keep you from them, and from such false friends!"}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "God keep me from false friends! but they were none."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "God bless your grace with health and happy days!"}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all."}
{"text": "I thought my mother, and my brother York,"}
{"text": "Would long ere this have met us on the way"}
{"text": "Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not"}
{"text": "To tell us whether they will come or no!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "On what occasion, God he knows, not I,"}
{"text": "The queen your mother, and your brother York,"}
{"text": "Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince"}
{"text": "Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,"}
{"text": "But by his mother was perforce withheld."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Fie, what an indirect and peevish course"}
{"text": "Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace"}
{"text": "Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York"}
{"text": "Unto his princely brother presently?"}
{"text": "If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,"}
{"text": "And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce."}
{"text": "CARDINAL:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory"}
{"text": "Can from his mother win the Duke of York,"}
{"text": "Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate"}
{"text": "To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid"}
{"text": "We should infringe the holy privilege"}
{"text": "Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land"}
{"text": "Would I be guilty of so deep a sin."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,"}
{"text": "Too ceremonious and traditional"}
{"text": "Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,"}
{"text": "You break not sanctuary in seizing him."}
{"text": "The benefit thereof is always granted"}
{"text": "To those whose dealings have deserved the place,"}
{"text": "And those who have the wit to claim the place:"}
{"text": "This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;"}
{"text": "And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:"}
{"text": "Then, taking him from thence that is not there,"}
{"text": "You break no privilege nor charter there."}
{"text": "Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;"}
{"text": "But sanctuary children ne'er till now."}
{"text": "CARDINAL:"}
{"text": "My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once."}
{"text": "Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I go, my lord."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may."}
{"text": "Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,"}
{"text": "Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Where it seems best unto your royal self."}
{"text": "If I may counsel you, some day or two"}
{"text": "Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:"}
{"text": "Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit"}
{"text": "For your best health and recreation."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "I do not like the Tower, of any place."}
{"text": "Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;"}
{"text": "Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Is it upon record, or else reported"}
{"text": "Successively from age to age, he built it?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Upon record, my gracious lord."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "But say, my lord, it were not register'd,"}
{"text": "Methinks the truth should live from age to age,"}
{"text": "As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,"}
{"text": "Even to the general all-ending day."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "What say you, uncle?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I say, without characters, fame lives long."}
{"text": "Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,"}
{"text": "I moralize two meanings in one word."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "That Julius Caesar was a famous man;"}
{"text": "With what his valour did enrich his wit,"}
{"text": "His wit set down to make his valour live"}
{"text": "Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;"}
{"text": "For now he lives in fame, though not in life."}
{"text": "I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "What, my gracious lord?"}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "An if I live until I be a man,"}
{"text": "I'll win our ancient right in France again,"}
{"text": "Or die a soldier, as I lived a king."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:"}
{"text": "Too late he died that might have kept that title,"}
{"text": "Which by his death hath lost much majesty."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,"}
{"text": "You said that idle weeds are fast in growth"}

{"text": "He hath, my lord."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "And therefore is he idle?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "O, my fair cousin, I must not say so."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Then is he more beholding to you than I."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "He may command me as my sovereign;"}
{"text": "But you have power in me as in a kinsman."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "A beggar, brother?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;"}
{"text": "And being but a toy, which is no grief to give."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "A gentle cousin, were it light enough."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;"}
{"text": "In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "It is too heavy for your grace to wear."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "I weigh it lightly, were it heavier."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What, would you have my weapon, little lord?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "I would, that I might thank you as you call me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "How?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Little."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:"}
{"text": "Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:"}
{"text": "Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;"}
{"text": "Because that I am little, like an ape,"}
{"text": "He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!"}
{"text": "To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,"}
{"text": "He prettily and aptly taunts himself:"}
{"text": "So cunning and so young is wonderful."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My lord, will't please you pass along?"}
{"text": "Myself and my good cousin Buckingham"}
{"text": "Will to your mother, to entreat of her"}
{"text": "To meet you at the Tower and welcome you."}
{"text": "YORK:"}

{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "My lord protector needs will have it so."}

{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Nor none that live, I hope."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "An if they live, I hope I need not fear."}
{"text": "But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,"}
{"text": "Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Think you, my lord, this little prating York"}
{"text": "Was not incensed by his subtle mother"}
{"text": "To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;"}
{"text": "Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable"}
{"text": "He is all the mother's, from the top to toe."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby."}
{"text": "Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend"}
{"text": "As closely to conceal what we impart:"}
{"text": "Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;"}
{"text": "What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter"}
{"text": "To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,"}
{"text": "For the instalment of this noble duke"}
{"text": "In the seat royal of this famous isle?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "He for his father's sake so loves the prince,"}
{"text": "That he will not be won to aught against him."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "He will do all in all as Hastings doth."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,"}
{"text": "And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,"}
{"text": "How doth he stand affected to our purpose;"}
{"text": "And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,"}
{"text": "To sit about the coronation."}
{"text": "If thou dost find him tractable to us,"}
{"text": "Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:"}
{"text": "If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,"}
{"text": "Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,"}
{"text": "And give us notice of his inclination:"}
{"text": "For we to-morrow hold divided councils,"}
{"text": "Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,"}
{"text": "His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries"}
{"text": "To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;"}
{"text": "And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,"}
{"text": "Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My good lords both, with all the heed I may."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "You shall, my lord."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive"}
{"text": "Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:"}
{"text": "And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me"}
{"text": "The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables"}
{"text": "Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And look to have it yielded with all willingness."}
{"text": "Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards"}
{"text": "We may digest our complots in some form."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "What, ho! my lord!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "A messenger from the Lord Stanley."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "What is't o'clock?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Upon the stroke of four."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "So it should seem by that I have to say."}
{"text": "First, he commends him to your noble lordship."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "And then?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "And then he sends you word"}
{"text": "He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:"}
{"text": "Besides, he says there are two councils held;"}
{"text": "And that may be determined at the one"}
{"text": "which may make you and him to rue at the other."}
{"text": "Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,"}
{"text": "If presently you will take horse with him,"}
{"text": "And with all speed post with him toward the north,"}
{"text": "To shun the danger that his soul divines."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;"}
{"text": "Bid him not fear the separated councils"}
{"text": "His honour and myself are at the one,"}
{"text": "And at the other is my servant Catesby"}
{"text": "Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us"}
{"text": "Whereof I shall not have intelligence."}
{"text": "Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:"}
{"text": "And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond"}
{"text": "To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers"}
{"text": "To fly the boar before the boar pursues,"}
{"text": "Were to incense the boar to follow us"}
{"text": "And make pursuit where he did mean no chase."}
{"text": "Go, bid thy master rise and come to me"}
{"text": "And we will both together to the Tower,"}
{"text": "Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Many good morrows to my noble lord!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring"}
{"text": "What news, what news, in this our tottering state?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;"}
{"text": "And I believe twill never stand upright"}
{"text": "Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Ay, my good lord."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders"}
{"text": "Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced."}
{"text": "But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward"}
{"text": "Upon his party for the gain thereof:"}
{"text": "And thereupon he sends you this good news,"}
{"text": "That this same very day your enemies,"}
{"text": "The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,"}
{"text": "Because they have been still mine enemies:"}
{"text": "But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,"}
{"text": "To bar my master's heirs in true descent,"}
{"text": "God knows I will not do it, to the death."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,"}
{"text": "That they who brought me in my master's hate"}
{"text": "I live to look upon their tragedy."}
{"text": "I tell thee, Catesby--"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "What, my lord?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Ere a fortnight make me elder,"}
{"text": "I'll send some packing that yet think not on it."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,"}
{"text": "When men are unprepared and look not for it."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out"}
{"text": "With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do"}
{"text": "With some men else, who think themselves as safe"}
{"text": "As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear"}
{"text": "To princely Richard and to Buckingham."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "The princes both make high account of you;"}
{"text": "For they account his head upon the bridge."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I know they do; and I have well deserved it."}
{"text": "Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?"}
{"text": "Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:"}
{"text": "You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,"}
{"text": "I do not like these several councils, I."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "My lord,"}
{"text": "I hold my life as dear as you do yours;"}
{"text": "And never in my life, I do protest,"}
{"text": "Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:"}
{"text": "Think you, but that I know our state secure,"}
{"text": "I would be so triumphant as I am?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,"}
{"text": "Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,"}
{"text": "And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;"}
{"text": "But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast."}
{"text": "This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:"}
{"text": "Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!"}
{"text": "What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?"}
{"text": "To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded."}
{"text": "LORD STANLEY:"}
{"text": "They, for their truth, might better wear their heads"}
{"text": "Than some that have accused them wear their hats."}
{"text": "But come, my lord, let us away."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow."}
{"text": "How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?"}
{"text": "Pursuivant:"}
{"text": "The better that your lordship please to ask."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now"}
{"text": "Than when I met thee last where now we meet:"}
{"text": "Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,"}
{"text": "By the suggestion of the queen's allies;"}
{"text": "But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--"}
{"text": "This day those enemies are put to death,"}
{"text": "And I in better state than e'er I was."}
{"text": "Pursuivant:"}
{"text": "God hold it, to your honour's good content!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me."}
{"text": "Pursuivant:"}
{"text": "God save your lordship!"}
{"text": "Priest:"}
{"text": "Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart."}
{"text": "I am in your debt for your last exercise;"}
{"text": "Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?"}
{"text": "Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;"}
{"text": "Your honour hath no shriving work in hand."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Good faith, and when I met this holy man,"}
{"text": "Those men you talk of came into my mind."}
{"text": "What, go you toward the Tower?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay"}
{"text": "I shall return before your lordship thence."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I'll wait upon your lordship."}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "Come, bring forth the prisoners."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:"}
{"text": "To-day shalt thou behold a subject die"}
{"text": "For truth, for duty, and for loyalty."}
{"text": "GREY:"}
{"text": "God keep the prince from all the pack of you!"}
{"text": "A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!"}
{"text": "VAUGHAN:"}
{"text": "You live that shall cry woe for this after."}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,"}
{"text": "Fatal and ominous to noble peers!"}
{"text": "Within the guilty closure of thy walls"}
{"text": "Richard the second here was hack'd to death;"}
{"text": "And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,"}
{"text": "We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink."}
{"text": "GREY:"}
{"text": "Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,"}
{"text": "For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,"}
{"text": "Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God"}
{"text": "To hear her prayers for them, as now for us"}
{"text": "And for my sister and her princely sons,"}
{"text": "Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,"}
{"text": "Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt."}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "Make haste; the hour of death is expiate."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:"}
{"text": "And take our leave, until we meet in heaven."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "My lords, at once: the cause why we are met"}
{"text": "Is, to determine of the coronation."}
{"text": "In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Are all things fitting for that royal time?"}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "It is, and wants but nomination."}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?"}
{"text": "Who is most inward with the royal duke?"}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,"}
{"text": "But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,"}
{"text": "Than I of yours;"}
{"text": "Nor I no more of his, than you of mine."}
{"text": "Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;"}
{"text": "But, for his purpose in the coronation."}
{"text": "I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd"}
{"text": "His gracious pleasure any way therein:"}
{"text": "But you, my noble lords, may name the time;"}
{"text": "And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,"}
{"text": "Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part."}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "Now in good time, here comes the duke himself."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow."}
{"text": "I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,"}
{"text": "My absence doth neglect no great designs,"}
{"text": "Which by my presence might have been concluded."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Had not you come upon your cue, my lord"}
{"text": "William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--"}
{"text": "I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;"}
{"text": "His lordship knows me well, and loves me well."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "I thank your grace."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My lord of Ely!"}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "My lord?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "When I was last in Holborn,"}
{"text": "I saw good strawberries in your garden there"}
{"text": "I do beseech you send for some of them."}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you."}
{"text": "Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,"}
{"text": "And finds the testy gentleman so hot,"}
{"text": "As he will lose his head ere give consent"}
{"text": "His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,"}
{"text": "Shall lose the royalty of England's throne."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you."}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "We have not yet set down this day of triumph."}
{"text": "To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;"}
{"text": "For I myself am not so well provided"}
{"text": "As else I would be, were the day prolong'd."}
{"text": "BISHOP OF ELY:"}
{"text": "Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these"}
{"text": "strawberries."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;"}
{"text": "There's some conceit or other likes him well,"}
{"text": "When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit."}
{"text": "I think there's never a man in Christendom"}
{"text": "That can less hide his love or hate than he;"}
{"text": "For by his face straight shall you know his heart."}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "What of his heart perceive you in his face"}
{"text": "By any likelihood he show'd to-day?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Marry, that with no man here he is offended;"}
{"text": "For, were he, he had shown it in his looks."}
{"text": "DERBY:"}
{"text": "I pray God he be not, I say."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I pray you all, tell me what they deserve"}
{"text": "That do conspire my death with devilish plots"}
{"text": "Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd"}
{"text": "Upon my body with their hellish charms?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,"}
{"text": "Makes me most forward in this noble presence"}
{"text": "To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be"}
{"text": "I say, my lord, they have deserved death."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:"}
{"text": "See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm"}
{"text": "Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:"}
{"text": "And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,"}
{"text": "Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,"}
{"text": "That by their witchcraft thus have marked me."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--"}
{"text": "Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:"}
{"text": "Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,"}
{"text": "I will not dine until I see the same."}
{"text": "Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:"}
{"text": "The rest, that love me, rise and follow me."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;"}
{"text": "For I, too fond, might have prevented this."}
{"text": "Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;"}
{"text": "But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:"}
{"text": "Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,"}
{"text": "And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,"}
{"text": "As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house."}
{"text": "O, now I want the priest that spake to me:"}
{"text": "I now repent I told the pursuivant"}
{"text": "As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,"}
{"text": "How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,"}
{"text": "And I myself secure in grace and favour."}
{"text": "O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse"}
{"text": "Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!"}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:"}
{"text": "Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "O momentary grace of mortal men,"}
{"text": "Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!"}
{"text": "Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,"}
{"text": "Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,"}
{"text": "Ready, with every nod, to tumble down"}
{"text": "Into the fatal bowels of the deep."}
{"text": "LOVEL:"}
{"text": "Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "O bloody Richard! miserable England!"}
{"text": "I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee"}
{"text": "That ever wretched age hath look'd upon."}
{"text": "Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head."}
{"text": "They smile at me that shortly shall be dead."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,"}
{"text": "Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,"}
{"text": "And then begin again, and stop again,"}
{"text": "As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;"}
{"text": "Speak and look back, and pry on every side,"}
{"text": "Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,"}
{"text": "Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks"}
{"text": "Are at my service, like enforced smiles;"}
{"text": "And both are ready in their offices,"}
{"text": "At any time, to grace my stratagems."}
{"text": "But what, is Catesby gone?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Lord mayor,--"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Look to the drawbridge there!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Hark! a drum."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Catesby, o'erlook the walls."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Look back, defend thee, here are enemies."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "God and our innocency defend and guard us!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel."}
{"text": "LOVEL:"}
{"text": "Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,"}
{"text": "The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "So dear I loved the man, that I must weep."}
{"text": "I took him for the plainest harmless creature"}
{"text": "That breathed upon this earth a Christian;"}
{"text": "Made him my book wherein my soul recorded"}
{"text": "The history of all her secret thoughts:"}
{"text": "So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,"}
{"text": "That, his apparent open guilt omitted,"}
{"text": "I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,"}
{"text": "He lived from all attainder of suspect."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor"}
{"text": "That ever lived."}
{"text": "Would you imagine, or almost believe,"}
{"text": "Were't not that, by great preservation,"}
{"text": "We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor"}
{"text": "This day had plotted, in the council-house"}
{"text": "To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?"}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "What, had he so?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What, think You we are Turks or infidels?"}
{"text": "Or that we would, against the form of law,"}
{"text": "Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,"}
{"text": "But that the extreme peril of the case,"}
{"text": "The peace of England and our persons' safety,"}
{"text": "Enforced us to this execution?"}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;"}
{"text": "And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,"}
{"text": "To warn false traitors from the like attempts."}
{"text": "I never look'd for better at his hands,"}
{"text": "After he once fell in with Mistress Shore."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Yet had not we determined he should die,"}
{"text": "Until your lordship came to see his death;"}
{"text": "Which now the loving haste of these our friends,"}
{"text": "Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:"}
{"text": "Because, my lord, we would have had you heard"}
{"text": "The traitor speak, and timorously confess"}
{"text": "The manner and the purpose of his treason;"}
{"text": "That you might well have signified the same"}
{"text": "Unto the citizens, who haply may"}
{"text": "Misconstrue us in him and wail his death."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,"}
{"text": "As well as I had seen and heard him speak"}
{"text": "And doubt you not, right noble princes both,"}
{"text": "But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens"}
{"text": "With all your just proceedings in this cause."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,"}
{"text": "To avoid the carping censures of the world."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "But since you come too late of our intents,"}
{"text": "Yet witness what you hear we did intend:"}
{"text": "And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham."}
{"text": "The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:"}
{"text": "There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,"}
{"text": "Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:"}
{"text": "Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,"}
{"text": "Only for saying he would make his son"}
{"text": "Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,"}
{"text": "Which, by the sign thereof was termed so."}
{"text": "Moreover, urge his hateful luxury"}
{"text": "And bestial appetite in change of lust;"}
{"text": "Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,"}
{"text": "Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,"}
{"text": "Without control, listed to make his prey."}
{"text": "Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:"}
{"text": "Tell them, when that my mother went with child"}
{"text": "Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York"}
{"text": "My princely father then had wars in France"}
{"text": "And, by just computation of the time,"}
{"text": "Found that the issue was not his begot;"}
{"text": "Which well appeared in his lineaments,"}
{"text": "Being nothing like the noble duke my father:"}
{"text": "But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,"}
{"text": "Because you know, my lord, my mother lives."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator"}
{"text": "As if the golden fee for which I plead"}
{"text": "Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;"}
{"text": "Where you shall find me well accompanied"}
{"text": "With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I go: and towards three or four o'clock"}
{"text": "Look for the news that the Guildhall affords."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;"}
{"text": "Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both"}
{"text": "Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle."}
{"text": "Now will I in, to take some privy order,"}
{"text": "To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;"}
{"text": "And to give notice, that no manner of person"}
{"text": "At any time have recourse unto the princes."}
{"text": "Scrivener:"}
{"text": "This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;"}
{"text": "Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,"}
{"text": "That it may be this day read over in Paul's."}
{"text": "And mark how well the sequel hangs together:"}
{"text": "Eleven hours I spent to write it over,"}
{"text": "For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;"}
{"text": "The precedent was full as long a-doing:"}
{"text": "And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,"}
{"text": "Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty"}
{"text": "Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,"}
{"text": "That seeth not this palpable device?"}
{"text": "Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?"}
{"text": "Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,"}
{"text": "When such bad dealings must be seen in thought."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "How now, my lord, what say the citizens?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,"}
{"text": "The citizens are mum and speak not a word."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,"}
{"text": "And his contract by deputy in France;"}
{"text": "The insatiate greediness of his desires,"}
{"text": "And his enforcement of the city wives;"}
{"text": "His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,"}
{"text": "As being got, your father then in France,"}
{"text": "His resemblance, being not like the duke;"}
{"text": "Withal I did infer your lineaments,"}
{"text": "Being the right idea of your father,"}
{"text": "Both in your form and nobleness of mind;"}
{"text": "Laid open all your victories in Scotland,"}
{"text": "Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,"}
{"text": "Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:"}
{"text": "Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose"}
{"text": "Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse"}
{"text": "And when mine oratory grew to an end"}
{"text": "I bid them that did love their country's good"}
{"text": "Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Ah! and did they so?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "No, so God help me, they spake not a word;"}
{"text": "But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,"}
{"text": "Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale."}
{"text": "Which when I saw, I reprehended them;"}
{"text": "And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:"}
{"text": "His answer was, the people were not wont"}
{"text": "To be spoke to but by the recorder."}
{"text": "Then he was urged to tell my tale again,"}
{"text": "'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'"}
{"text": "But nothing spake in warrant from himself."}
{"text": "When he had done, some followers of mine own,"}
{"text": "At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,"}
{"text": "And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'"}
{"text": "And thus I took the vantage of those few,"}
{"text": "'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;"}
{"text": "'This general applause and loving shout"}
{"text": "Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'"}
{"text": "And even here brake off, and came away."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "No, by my troth, my lord."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;"}
{"text": "Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:"}
{"text": "And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,"}
{"text": "And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;"}
{"text": "For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:"}
{"text": "And be not easily won to our request:"}
{"text": "Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I go; and if you plead as well for them"}
{"text": "As I can say nay to thee for myself,"}
{"text": "No doubt well bring it to a happy issue."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks."}
{"text": "Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;"}
{"text": "I think the duke will not be spoke withal."}
{"text": "Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,"}
{"text": "What says he?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My lord: he doth entreat your grace;"}
{"text": "To visit him to-morrow or next day:"}
{"text": "He is within, with two right reverend fathers,"}
{"text": "Divinely bent to meditation;"}
{"text": "And no worldly suit would he be moved,"}
{"text": "To draw him from his holy exercise."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;"}
{"text": "Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,"}
{"text": "In deep designs and matters of great moment,"}
{"text": "No less importing than our general good,"}
{"text": "Are come to have some conference with his grace."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "I'll tell him what you say, my lord."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!"}
{"text": "He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,"}
{"text": "But on his knees at meditation;"}
{"text": "Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,"}
{"text": "But meditating with two deep divines;"}
{"text": "Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,"}
{"text": "But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:"}
{"text": "Happy were England, would this gracious prince"}
{"text": "Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:"}
{"text": "But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I fear he will."}
{"text": "How now, Catesby, what says your lord?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My lord,"}
{"text": "He wonders to what end you have assembled"}
{"text": "Such troops of citizens to speak with him,"}
{"text": "His grace not being warn'd thereof before:"}
{"text": "My lord, he fears you mean no good to him."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Sorry I am my noble cousin should"}
{"text": "Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:"}
{"text": "By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;"}
{"text": "And so once more return and tell his grace."}
{"text": "When holy and devout religious men"}
{"text": "Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,"}
{"text": "So sweet is zealous contemplation."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "See, where he stands between two clergymen!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,"}
{"text": "To stay him from the fall of vanity:"}
{"text": "And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,"}
{"text": "True ornaments to know a holy man."}
{"text": "Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,"}
{"text": "Lend favourable ears to our request;"}
{"text": "And pardon us the interruption"}
{"text": "Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "My lord, there needs no such apology:"}
{"text": "I rather do beseech you pardon me,"}
{"text": "Who, earnest in the service of my God,"}
{"text": "Neglect the visitation of my friends."}
{"text": "But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,"}
{"text": "And all good men of this ungovern'd isle."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I do suspect I have done some offence"}
{"text": "That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,"}
{"text": "And that you come to reprehend my ignorance."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,"}
{"text": "At our entreaties, to amend that fault!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Then know, it is your fault that you resign"}
{"text": "The supreme seat, the throne majestical,"}
{"text": "The scepter'd office of your ancestors,"}
{"text": "Your state of fortune and your due of birth,"}
{"text": "The lineal glory of your royal house,"}
{"text": "To the corruption of a blemished stock:"}
{"text": "Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,"}
{"text": "Which here we waken to our country's good,"}
{"text": "This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;"}
{"text": "Her face defaced with scars of infamy,"}
{"text": "Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,"}
{"text": "And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf"}
{"text": "Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion."}
{"text": "Which to recure, we heartily solicit"}
{"text": "Your gracious self to take on you the charge"}
{"text": "And kingly government of this your land,"}
{"text": "Not as protector, steward, substitute,"}
{"text": "Or lowly factor for another's gain;"}
{"text": "But as successively from blood to blood,"}
{"text": "Your right of birth, your empery, your own."}
{"text": "For this, consorted with the citizens,"}
{"text": "Your very worshipful and loving friends,"}
{"text": "And by their vehement instigation,"}
{"text": "In this just suit come I to move your grace."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "I know not whether to depart in silence,"}
{"text": "Or bitterly to speak in your reproof."}
{"text": "Best fitteth my degree or your condition"}
{"text": "If not to answer, you might haply think"}
{"text": "Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded"}
{"text": "To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,"}
{"text": "Which fondly you would here impose on me;"}
{"text": "If to reprove you for this suit of yours,"}
{"text": "So season'd with your faithful love to me."}
{"text": "Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends."}
{"text": "Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,"}
{"text": "And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,"}
{"text": "Definitively thus I answer you."}
{"text": "Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert"}
{"text": "Unmeritable shuns your high request."}
{"text": "First if all obstacles were cut away,"}
{"text": "And that my path were even to the crown,"}
{"text": "As my ripe revenue and due by birth"}
{"text": "Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,"}
{"text": "So mighty and so many my defects,"}
{"text": "As I had rather hide me from my greatness,"}
{"text": "Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,"}
{"text": "Than in my greatness covet to be hid,"}
{"text": "And in the vapour of my glory smother'd."}
{"text": "But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,"}
{"text": "And much I need to help you, if need were;"}
{"text": "The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,"}
{"text": "Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,"}
{"text": "Will well become the seat of majesty,"}
{"text": "And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign."}
{"text": "On him I lay what you would lay on me,"}
{"text": "The right and fortune of his happy stars;"}
{"text": "Which God defend that I should wring from him!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;"}
{"text": "But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,"}
{"text": "All circumstances well considered."}
{"text": "You say that Edward is your brother's son:"}
{"text": "So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;"}
{"text": "For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--"}
{"text": "Your mother lives a witness to that vow--"}
{"text": "And afterward by substitute betroth'd"}
{"text": "To Bona, sister to the King of France."}
{"text": "These both put by a poor petitioner,"}
{"text": "A care-crazed mother of a many children,"}
{"text": "A beauty-waning and distressed widow,"}
{"text": "Even in the afternoon of her best days,"}
{"text": "Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,"}
{"text": "Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts"}
{"text": "To base declension and loathed bigamy"}
{"text": "By her, in his unlawful bed, he got"}
{"text": "This Edward, whom our manners term the prince."}
{"text": "More bitterly could I expostulate,"}
{"text": "Save that, for reverence to some alive,"}
{"text": "I give a sparing limit to my tongue."}
{"text": "Then, good my lord, take to your royal self"}
{"text": "This proffer'd benefit of dignity;"}
{"text": "If non to bless us and the land withal,"}
{"text": "Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry"}
{"text": "From the corruption of abusing times,"}
{"text": "Unto a lineal true-derived course."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?"}
{"text": "I am unfit for state and majesty;"}
{"text": "I do beseech you, take it not amiss;"}
{"text": "I cannot nor I will not yield to you."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,"}
{"text": "Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;"}
{"text": "As well we know your tenderness of heart"}
{"text": "And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,"}
{"text": "Which we have noted in you to your kin,"}
{"text": "And egally indeed to all estates,--"}
{"text": "Yet whether you accept our suit or no,"}
{"text": "Your brother's son shall never reign our king;"}
{"text": "But we will plant some other in the throne,"}
{"text": "To the disgrace and downfall of your house:"}
{"text": "And in this resolution here we leave you.--"}
{"text": "Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit."}
{"text": "ANOTHER:"}
{"text": "Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Would you enforce me to a world of care?"}
{"text": "Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,"}
{"text": "But penetrable to your. kind entreats,"}
{"text": "Albeit against my conscience and my soul."}
{"text": "Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,"}
{"text": "Since you will buckle fortune on my back,"}
{"text": "To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,"}
{"text": "I must have patience to endure the load:"}
{"text": "But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach"}
{"text": "Attend the sequel of your imposition,"}
{"text": "Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me"}
{"text": "From all the impure blots and stains thereof;"}
{"text": "For God he knows, and you may partly see,"}
{"text": "How far I am from the desire thereof."}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "In saying so, you shall but say the truth."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Then I salute you with this kingly title:"}
{"text": "Long live Richard, England's royal king!"}
{"text": "Lord Mayor:"}
{"text": "Amen."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Even when you please, since you will have it so."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:"}
{"text": "And so most joyfully we take our leave."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Come, let us to our holy task again."}
{"text": "Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet"}
{"text": "Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?"}
{"text": "Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,"}
{"text": "On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes."}
{"text": "Daughter, well met."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "God give your graces both"}
{"text": "A happy and a joyful time of day!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "As much to you, good sister! Whither away?"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,"}
{"text": "Upon the like devotion as yourselves,"}
{"text": "To gratulate the gentle princes there."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together."}
{"text": "And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes."}
{"text": "Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,"}
{"text": "How doth the prince, and my young son of York?"}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "Right well, dear madam. By your patience,"}
{"text": "I may not suffer you to visit them;"}
{"text": "The king hath straitly charged the contrary."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "The king! why, who's that?"}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "The Lord protect him from that kingly title!"}
{"text": "Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?"}
{"text": "I am their mother; who should keep me from them?"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I am their fathers mother; I will see them."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:"}
{"text": "Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame"}
{"text": "And take thy office from thee, on my peril."}
{"text": "BRAKENBURY:"}
{"text": "No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:"}
{"text": "I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me."}
{"text": "LORD STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,"}
{"text": "And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,"}
{"text": "And reverend looker on, of two fair queens."}
{"text": "Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,"}
{"text": "There to be crowned Richard's royal queen."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart"}
{"text": "May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon"}
{"text": "With this dead-killing news!"}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!"}
{"text": "DORSET:"}
{"text": "Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!"}
{"text": "Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;"}
{"text": "Thy mother's name is ominous to children."}
{"text": "If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,"}
{"text": "And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell"}
{"text": "Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,"}
{"text": "Lest thou increase the number of the dead;"}
{"text": "And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,"}
{"text": "Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen."}
{"text": "LORD STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam."}
{"text": "Take all the swift advantage of the hours;"}
{"text": "You shall have letters from me to my son"}
{"text": "To meet you on the way, and welcome you."}
{"text": "Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "O ill-dispersing wind of misery!"}
{"text": "O my accursed womb, the bed of death!"}
{"text": "A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,"}
{"text": "Whose unavoided eye is murderous."}
{"text": "LORD STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "And I in all unwillingness will go."}
{"text": "I would to God that the inclusive verge"}
{"text": "Of golden metal that must round my brow"}
{"text": "Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!"}
{"text": "Anointed let me be with deadly venom,"}
{"text": "And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory"}
{"text": "To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm."}
{"text": "LADY ANNE:"}
{"text": "No! why?  When he that is my husband now"}
{"text": "Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,"}
{"text": "When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands"}
{"text": "Which issued from my other angel husband"}
{"text": "And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;"}
{"text": "O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,"}
{"text": "This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,"}
{"text": "For making me, so young, so old a widow!"}
{"text": "And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;"}
{"text": "And be thy wife--if any be so mad--"}

{"text": "As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!"}
{"text": "Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,"}
{"text": "Even in so short a space, my woman's heart"}
{"text": "Grossly grew captive to his honey words"}
{"text": "And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,"}
{"text": "Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;"}
{"text": "For never yet one hour in his bed"}
{"text": "Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,"}
{"text": "But have been waked by his timorous dreams."}
{"text": "Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;"}

{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My gracious sovereign?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Give me thy hand."}
{"text": "Thus high, by thy advice"}
{"text": "And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;"}
{"text": "But shall we wear these honours for a day?"}
{"text": "Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Still live they and for ever may they last!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,"}
{"text": "To try if thou be current gold indeed"}
{"text": "Young Edward lives: think now what I would say."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Say on, my loving lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "True, noble prince."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "O bitter consequence,"}
{"text": "That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'"}
{"text": "Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:"}
{"text": "Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;"}
{"text": "And I would have it suddenly perform'd."}
{"text": "What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Your grace may do your pleasure."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:"}

{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord"}
{"text": "Before I positively herein:"}
{"text": "I will resolve your grace immediately."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "I will converse with iron-witted fools"}

{"text": "That look into me with considerate eyes:"}
{"text": "High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect."}
{"text": "Boy!"}
{"text": "Page:"}
{"text": "My lord?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold"}
{"text": "Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?"}
{"text": "Page:"}
{"text": "My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,"}
{"text": "Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:"}

{"text": "And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}

{"text": "Catesby!"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My lord?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Rumour it abroad"}
{"text": "That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:"}
{"text": "I will take order for her keeping close."}
{"text": "Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,"}
{"text": "Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:"}
{"text": "The boy is foolish, and I fear not him."}
{"text": "Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out"}
{"text": "That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:"}
{"text": "About it; for it stands me much upon,"}
{"text": "To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me."}
{"text": "I must be married to my brother's daughter,"}
{"text": "Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass."}
{"text": "Murder her brothers, and then marry her!"}
{"text": "Uncertain way of gain! But I am in"}
{"text": "So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:"}

{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Art thou, indeed?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "Prove me, my gracious sovereign."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "Ay, my lord;"}
{"text": "But I had rather kill two enemies."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,"}
{"text": "Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers"}
{"text": "Are they that I would have thee deal upon:"}
{"text": "Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower."}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "Let me have open means to come to them,"}
{"text": "And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel"}
{"text": "Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:"}
{"text": "There is no more but so: say it is done,"}
{"text": "And I will love thee, and prefer thee too."}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "'Tis done, my gracious lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "Ye shall, my Lord."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind"}
{"text": "The late demand that you did sound me in."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I hear that news, my lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,"}
{"text": "For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;"}
{"text": "The earldom of Hereford and the moveables"}
{"text": "The which you promised I should possess."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey"}
{"text": "Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "What says your highness to my just demand?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "As I remember, Henry the Sixth"}
{"text": "Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,"}
{"text": "When Richmond was a little peevish boy."}
{"text": "A king, perhaps, perhaps,--"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My lord!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "How chance the prophet could not at that time"}
{"text": "Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My lord, your promise for the earldom,--"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,"}
{"text": "The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,"}
{"text": "And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,"}
{"text": "Because a bard of Ireland told me once"}
{"text": "I should not live long after I saw Richmond."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "My Lord!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ay, what's o'clock?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "I am thus bold to put your grace in mind"}
{"text": "Of what you promised me."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Well, but what's o'clock?"}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Upon the stroke of ten."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Well, let it strike."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Why let it strike?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke"}
{"text": "Betwixt thy begging and my meditation."}
{"text": "I am not in the giving vein to-day."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Why, then resolve me whether you will or no."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Tut, tut,"}
{"text": "Thou troublest me; am not in the vein."}
{"text": "BUCKINGHAM:"}
{"text": "Is it even so? rewards he my true service"}
{"text": "With such deep contempt made I him king for this?"}
{"text": "O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone"}
{"text": "To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "The tyrannous and bloody deed is done."}
{"text": "The most arch of piteous massacre"}
{"text": "That ever yet this land was guilty of."}
{"text": "Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn"}
{"text": "To do this ruthless piece of butchery,"}
{"text": "Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,"}
{"text": "Melting with tenderness and kind compassion"}
{"text": "Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories."}
{"text": "'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'"}
{"text": "'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another"}
{"text": "Within their innocent alabaster arms:"}
{"text": "Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,"}
{"text": "Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other."}
{"text": "A book of prayers on their pillow lay;"}
{"text": "Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;"}
{"text": "But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd"}
{"text": "Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered"}
{"text": "The most replenished sweet work of nature,"}
{"text": "That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'"}
{"text": "Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;"}
{"text": "They could not speak; and so I left them both,"}
{"text": "To bring this tidings to the bloody king."}
{"text": "And here he comes."}
{"text": "All hail, my sovereign liege!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "If to have done the thing you gave in charge"}
{"text": "Beget your happiness, be happy then,"}
{"text": "For it is done, my lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "But didst thou see them dead?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "I did, my lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "And buried, gentle Tyrrel?"}
{"text": "TYRREL:"}
{"text": "The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;"}
{"text": "But how or in what place I do not know."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,"}
{"text": "And thou shalt tell the process of their death."}
{"text": "Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,"}
{"text": "And be inheritor of thy desire."}
{"text": "Farewell till soon."}
{"text": "The son of Clarence have I pent up close;"}
{"text": "His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;"}
{"text": "The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,"}
{"text": "And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night."}
{"text": "Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims"}
{"text": "At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,"}
{"text": "And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,"}
{"text": "To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My lord!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;"}
{"text": "And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,"}
{"text": "Is in the field, and still his power increaseth."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ely with Richmond troubles me more near"}
{"text": "Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army."}
{"text": "Come, I have heard that fearful commenting"}
{"text": "Is leaden servitor to dull delay;"}
{"text": "Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary"}
{"text": "Then fiery expedition be my wing,"}
{"text": "Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!"}
{"text": "Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;"}
{"text": "We must be brief when traitors brave the field."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "So, now prosperity begins to mellow"}
{"text": "And drop into the rotten mouth of death."}
{"text": "Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,"}
{"text": "To watch the waning of mine adversaries."}
{"text": "A dire induction am I witness to,"}
{"text": "And will to France, hoping the consequence"}
{"text": "Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical."}
{"text": "Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!"}
{"text": "My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!"}
{"text": "If yet your gentle souls fly in the air"}
{"text": "And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,"}
{"text": "Hover about me with your airy wings"}

{"text": "O upright, just, and true-disposing God,"}

{"text": "One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;"}
{"text": "A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;"}

{"text": "Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish"}
{"text": "And never look upon thy face again."}
{"text": "Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;"}
{"text": "Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more"}
{"text": "Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!"}
{"text": "My prayers on the adverse party fight;"}
{"text": "And there the little souls of Edward's children"}
{"text": "Whisper the spirits of thine enemies"}
{"text": "And promise them success and victory."}
{"text": "Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;"}
{"text": "Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse"}
{"text": "Abides in me; I say amen to all."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "I have no more sons of the royal blood"}
{"text": "For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,"}
{"text": "They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;"}
{"text": "And therefore level not to hit their lives."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,"}
{"text": "Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "And must she die for this? O, let her live,"}
{"text": "And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;"}
{"text": "Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;"}
{"text": "Throw over her the veil of infamy:"}
{"text": "So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,"}
{"text": "I will confess she was not Edward's daughter."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "To save her life, I'll say she is not so."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Her life is only safest in her birth."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "And only in that safety died her brothers."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Lo, at their births good stars were opposite."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "No, to their lives bad friends were contrary."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "All unavoided is the doom of destiny."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "True, when avoided grace makes destiny:"}
{"text": "My babes were destined to a fairer death,"}
{"text": "If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "You speak as if that I had slain my cousins."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd"}
{"text": "Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life."}
{"text": "Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,"}
{"text": "Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:"}
{"text": "No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt"}
{"text": "Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,"}
{"text": "To revel in the entrails of my lambs."}
{"text": "But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,"}
{"text": "My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys"}
{"text": "Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;"}
{"text": "And I, in such a desperate bay of death,"}
{"text": "Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,"}
{"text": "Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise"}
{"text": "And dangerous success of bloody wars,"}
{"text": "As I intend more good to you and yours,"}
{"text": "Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,"}
{"text": "To be discover'd, that can do me good?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "The advancement of your children, gentle lady."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "No, to the dignity and height of honour"}
{"text": "The high imperial type of this earth's glory."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Flatter my sorrows with report of it;"}
{"text": "Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,"}
{"text": "Canst thou demise to any child of mine?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,"}
{"text": "Will I withal endow a child of thine;"}
{"text": "So in the Lethe of thy angry soul"}
{"text": "Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs"}
{"text": "Which thou supposest I have done to thee."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness"}
{"text": "Last longer telling than thy kindness' date."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "What do you think?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:"}
{"text": "So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;"}
{"text": "And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:"}
{"text": "I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,"}
{"text": "And mean to make her queen of England."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Even he that makes her queen who should be else?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "What, thou?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "I, even I: what think you of it, madam?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "How canst thou woo her?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "That would I learn of you,"}
{"text": "As one that are best acquainted with her humour."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "And wilt thou learn of me?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Madam, with all my heart."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,"}
{"text": "A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave"}
{"text": "Edward and York; then haply she will weep:"}
{"text": "Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret"}
{"text": "Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--"}
{"text": "A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain"}
{"text": "The purple sap from her sweet brother's body"}
{"text": "And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith."}
{"text": "If this inducement force her not to love,"}
{"text": "Send her a story of thy noble acts;"}
{"text": "Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,"}
{"text": "Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,"}
{"text": "Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way"}
{"text": "To win our daughter."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "There is no other way"}
{"text": "Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,"}
{"text": "And not be Richard that hath done all this."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Say that I did all this for love of her."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,"}
{"text": "Having bought love with such a bloody spoil."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Look, what is done cannot be now amended:"}
{"text": "Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,"}
{"text": "Which after hours give leisure to repent."}
{"text": "If I did take the kingdom from your sons,"}
{"text": "To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter."}
{"text": "If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,"}
{"text": "To quicken your increase, I will beget"}
{"text": "Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter"}
{"text": "A grandam's name is little less in love"}
{"text": "Than is the doting title of a mother;"}
{"text": "They are as children but one step below,"}
{"text": "Even of your mettle, of your very blood;"}
{"text": "Of an one pain, save for a night of groans"}
{"text": "Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow."}
{"text": "Your children were vexation to your youth,"}
{"text": "But mine shall be a comfort to your age."}
{"text": "The loss you have is but a son being king,"}
{"text": "And by that loss your daughter is made queen."}
{"text": "I cannot make you what amends I would,"}
{"text": "Therefore accept such kindness as I can."}
{"text": "Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul"}
{"text": "Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,"}
{"text": "This fair alliance quickly shall call home"}
{"text": "To high promotions and great dignity:"}
{"text": "The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife."}
{"text": "Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;"}
{"text": "Again shall you be mother to a king,"}
{"text": "And all the ruins of distressful times"}
{"text": "Repair'd with double riches of content."}
{"text": "What! we have many goodly days to see:"}
{"text": "The liquid drops of tears that you have shed"}
{"text": "Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,"}
{"text": "Advantaging their loan with interest"}
{"text": "Of ten times double gain of happiness."}
{"text": "Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go"}
{"text": "Make bold her bashful years with your experience;"}
{"text": "Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale"}
{"text": "Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame"}
{"text": "Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess"}
{"text": "With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys"}
{"text": "And when this arm of mine hath chastised"}
{"text": "The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,"}
{"text": "Bound with triumphant garlands will I come"}
{"text": "And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;"}
{"text": "To whom I will retail my conquest won,"}
{"text": "And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "What were I best to say? her father's brother"}
{"text": "Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?"}
{"text": "Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?"}
{"text": "Under what title shall I woo for thee,"}
{"text": "That God, the law, my honour and her love,"}
{"text": "Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Infer fair England's peace by this alliance."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Which she shall purchase with still lasting war."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Say that the king, which may command, entreats."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "That at her hands which the king's King forbids."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "To wail the tide, as her mother doth."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Say, I will love her everlastingly."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "But how long shall that title 'ever' last?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "So long as heaven and nature lengthens it."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "So long as hell and Richard likes of it."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Be eloquent in my behalf to her."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "An honest tale speeds best being plainly told."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Plain and not honest is too harsh a style."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Your reasons are too shallow and too quick."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;"}
{"text": "Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Harp not on that string, madam; that is past."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "I swear--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "By nothing; for this is no oath:"}
{"text": "The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;"}
{"text": "The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;"}
{"text": "The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory."}
{"text": "if something thou wilt swear to be believed,"}
{"text": "Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Now, by the world--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "'Tis full of thy foul wrongs."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "My father's death--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Thy life hath that dishonour'd."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Then, by myself--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Thyself thyself misusest."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Why then, by God--"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "God's wrong is most of all."}
{"text": "If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"}
{"text": "The unity the king thy brother made"}
{"text": "Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:"}
{"text": "If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"}
{"text": "The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,"}
{"text": "Had graced the tender temples of my child,"}
{"text": "And both the princes had been breathing here,"}
{"text": "Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,"}
{"text": "Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms."}
{"text": "What canst thou swear by now?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "The time to come."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;"}
{"text": "For I myself have many tears to wash"}
{"text": "Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee."}
{"text": "The children live, whose parents thou hast"}
{"text": "slaughter'd,"}
{"text": "Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;"}
{"text": "The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,"}
{"text": "Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age."}
{"text": "Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast"}
{"text": "Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "As I intend to prosper and repent,"}
{"text": "So thrive I in my dangerous attempt"}
{"text": "Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!"}
{"text": "Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!"}
{"text": "Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!"}
{"text": "Be opposite all planets of good luck"}
{"text": "To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,"}
{"text": "Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,"}
{"text": "I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!"}
{"text": "In her consists my happiness and thine;"}
{"text": "Without her, follows to this land and me,"}
{"text": "To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,"}
{"text": "Death, desolation, ruin and decay:"}
{"text": "It cannot be avoided but by this;"}
{"text": "It will not be avoided but by this."}
{"text": "Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--"}
{"text": "Be the attorney of my love to her:"}
{"text": "Plead what I will be, not what I have been;"}
{"text": "Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:"}
{"text": "Urge the necessity and state of times,"}
{"text": "And be not peevish-fond in great designs."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Shall I forget myself to be myself?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "But thou didst kill my children."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "But in your daughter's womb I bury them:"}
{"text": "Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed"}
{"text": "Selves of themselves, to your recomforture."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "And be a happy mother by the deed."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "I go. Write to me very shortly."}
{"text": "And you shall understand from me her mind."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell."}
{"text": "Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!"}
{"text": "How now! what news?"}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "My gracious sovereign, on the western coast"}
{"text": "Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore"}
{"text": "Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,"}
{"text": "Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:"}
{"text": "'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;"}
{"text": "And there they hull, expecting but the aid"}
{"text": "Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:"}
{"text": "Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "Here, my lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Fly to the duke:"}
{"text": "Post thou to Salisbury"}
{"text": "When thou comest thither--"}
{"text": "Dull, unmindful villain,"}
{"text": "Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?"}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,"}
{"text": "What from your grace I shall deliver to him."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight"}
{"text": "The greatest strength and power he can make,"}
{"text": "And meet me presently at Salisbury."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "I go."}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at"}
{"text": "Salisbury?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?"}
{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "Your highness told me I should post before."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed."}
{"text": "How now, what news with you?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;"}
{"text": "Nor none so bad, but it may well be told."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!"}
{"text": "Why dost thou run so many mile about,"}
{"text": "When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?"}
{"text": "Once more, what news?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Richmond is on the seas."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "There let him sink, and be the seas on him!"}
{"text": "White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,"}
{"text": "He makes for England, there to claim the crown."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?"}
{"text": "Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?"}
{"text": "What heir of York is there alive but we?"}
{"text": "And who is England's king but great York's heir?"}
{"text": "Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Unless for that he comes to be your liege,"}
{"text": "You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes."}
{"text": "Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear."}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?"}
{"text": "Where are thy tenants and thy followers?"}
{"text": "Are they not now upon the western shore."}
{"text": "Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "No, my good lord, my friends are in the north."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,"}
{"text": "When they should serve their sovereign in the west?"}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:"}
{"text": "Please it your majesty to give me leave,"}
{"text": "I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace"}
{"text": "Where and what time your majesty shall please."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:"}
{"text": "I will not trust you, sir."}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "Most mighty sovereign,"}
{"text": "You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:"}
{"text": "I never was nor never will be false."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Well,"}
{"text": "Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind"}
{"text": "Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm."}
{"text": "Or else his head's assurance is but frail."}
{"text": "STANLEY:"}
{"text": "So deal with him as I prove true to you."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,"}
{"text": "As I by friends am well advertised,"}

{"text": "Third Messenger:"}
{"text": "My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?"}
{"text": "Take that, until thou bring me better news."}
{"text": "Third Messenger:"}
{"text": "The news I have to tell your majesty"}
{"text": "Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,"}
{"text": "Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;"}
{"text": "And he himself wander'd away alone,"}
{"text": "No man knows whither."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "I cry thee mercy:"}
{"text": "There is my purse to cure that blow of thine."}
{"text": "Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd"}
{"text": "Reward to him that brings the traitor in?"}

{"text": "The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:"}
{"text": "Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat"}
{"text": "Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks"}
{"text": "If they were his assistants, yea or no;"}
{"text": "Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham."}
{"text": "Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,"}
{"text": "Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "March on, march on, since we are up in arms;"}
{"text": "If not to fight with foreign enemies,"}
{"text": "Yet to beat down these rebels here at home."}
{"text": "CATESBY:"}
{"text": "My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;"}
{"text": "That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond"}
{"text": "Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,"}
{"text": "Is colder tidings, yet they must be told."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,"}

{"text": "The fear of that withholds my present aid."}
{"text": "But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?"}
{"text": "CHRISTOPHER:"}
{"text": "At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales."}

{"text": "In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--"}
{"text": "Prepare thy battle early in the morning,"}
{"text": "And put thy fortune to the arbitrement"}
{"text": "Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war."}
{"text": "I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--"}

{"text": "RATCLIFF:"}
{"text": "My lord?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "The sun will not be seen to-day;"}
{"text": "The sky doth frown and lour upon our army."}
{"text": "I would these dewy tears were from the ground."}
{"text": "Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me"}
{"text": "More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven"}
{"text": "That frowns on me looks sadly upon him."}
{"text": "NORFOLK:"}
{"text": "Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD III:"}
{"text": "Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse."}
{"text": "Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:"}
{"text": "I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,"}
{"text": "And thus my battle shall be ordered:"}

{"text": "John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,"}
{"text": "Shall have the leading of this foot and horse."}
{"text": "They thus directed, we will follow"}

{"text": "This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?"}
{"text": "NORFOLK:"}
{"text": "A good direction, warlike sovereign."}

{"text": "John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,"}
{"text": "Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon."}
{"text": "RICHMOND:"}
{"text": "Inter their bodies as becomes their births:"}

{"text": "Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,"}
{"text": "That long have frown'd upon their enmity!"}
{"text": "What traitor hears me, and says not amen?"}
{"text": "England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;"}
{"text": "The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,"}
{"text": "The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,"}
{"text": "The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:"}
{"text": "All this divided York and Lancaster,"}

{"text": "O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,"}
{"text": "The true succeeders of each royal house,"}
{"text": "By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!"}

{"text": "Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,"}
{"text": "With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!"}
{"text": "Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,"}
{"text": "That would reduce these bloody days again,"}

{"text": "Yet can I not of such tame patience boast"}
{"text": "As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:"}
{"text": "First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me"}
{"text": "From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;"}
{"text": "Which else would post until it had return'd"}
{"text": "These terms of treason doubled down his throat."}
{"text": "Setting aside his high blood's royalty,"}
{"text": "And let him be no kinsman to my liege,"}
{"text": "I do defy him, and I spit at him;"}
{"text": "Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:"}
{"text": "Which to maintain I would allow him odds,"}
{"text": "And meet him, were I tied to run afoot"}
{"text": "Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,"}
{"text": "Or any other ground inhabitable,"}
{"text": "Where ever Englishman durst set his foot."}
{"text": "Mean time let this defend my loyalty,"}
{"text": "By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,"}
{"text": "Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,"}
{"text": "And lay aside my high blood's royalty,"}
{"text": "Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except."}
{"text": "If guilty dread have left thee so much strength"}
{"text": "As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:"}
{"text": "By that and all the rites of knighthood else,"}
{"text": "Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,"}
{"text": "What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "I take it up; and by that sword I swear"}
{"text": "Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,"}
{"text": "I'll answer thee in any fair degree,"}
{"text": "Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:"}
{"text": "And when I mount, alive may I not light,"}
{"text": "If I be traitor or unjustly fight!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?"}
{"text": "It must be great that can inherit us"}
{"text": "So much as of a thought of ill in him."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;"}
{"text": "That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles"}
{"text": "In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,"}
{"text": "The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,"}
{"text": "Like a false traitor and injurious villain."}
{"text": "Besides I say and will in battle prove,"}
{"text": "Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge"}
{"text": "That ever was survey'd by English eye,"}
{"text": "That all the treasons for these eighteen years"}
{"text": "Complotted and contrived in this land"}
{"text": "Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring."}
{"text": "Further I say and further will maintain"}
{"text": "Upon his bad life to make all this good,"}
{"text": "That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,"}
{"text": "Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,"}
{"text": "And consequently, like a traitor coward,"}
{"text": "Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:"}
{"text": "Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,"}
{"text": "Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,"}
{"text": "To me for justice and rough chastisement;"}
{"text": "And, by the glorious worth of my descent,"}
{"text": "This arm shall do it, or this life be spent."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "How high a pitch his resolution soars!"}
{"text": "Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?"}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "O, let my sovereign turn away his face"}
{"text": "And bid his ears a little while be deaf,"}
{"text": "Till I have told this slander of his blood,"}
{"text": "How God and good men hate so foul a liar."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:"}
{"text": "Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,"}
{"text": "As he is but my father's brother's son,"}
{"text": "Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,"}
{"text": "Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood"}
{"text": "Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize"}
{"text": "The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:"}
{"text": "He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:"}
{"text": "Free speech and fearless I to thee allow."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,"}
{"text": "Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest."}
{"text": "Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais"}
{"text": "Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;"}
{"text": "The other part reserved I by consent,"}
{"text": "For that my sovereign liege was in my debt"}
{"text": "Upon remainder of a dear account,"}
{"text": "Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:"}
{"text": "Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,"}
{"text": "I slew him not; but to my own disgrace"}
{"text": "Neglected my sworn duty in that case."}
{"text": "For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,"}
{"text": "The honourable father to my foe"}
{"text": "Once did I lay an ambush for your life,"}
{"text": "A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul"}
{"text": "But ere I last received the sacrament"}
{"text": "I did confess it, and exactly begg'd"}
{"text": "Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it."}
{"text": "This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,"}
{"text": "It issues from the rancour of a villain,"}
{"text": "A recreant and most degenerate traitor"}
{"text": "Which in myself I boldly will defend;"}
{"text": "And interchangeably hurl down my gage"}
{"text": "Upon this overweening traitor's foot,"}
{"text": "To prove myself a loyal gentleman"}
{"text": "Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom."}
{"text": "In haste whereof, most heartily I pray"}
{"text": "Your highness to assign our trial day."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;"}
{"text": "Let's purge this choler without letting blood:"}
{"text": "This we prescribe, though no physician;"}
{"text": "Deep malice makes too deep incision;"}
{"text": "Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;"}
{"text": "Our doctors say this is no month to bleed."}
{"text": "Good uncle, let this end where it begun;"}
{"text": "We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "To be a make-peace shall become my age:"}
{"text": "Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "And, Norfolk, throw down his."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "When, Harry, when?"}
{"text": "Obedience bids I should not bid again."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot."}
{"text": "My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:"}
{"text": "The one my duty owes; but my fair name,"}
{"text": "Despite of death that lives upon my grave,"}
{"text": "To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have."}
{"text": "I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,"}
{"text": "Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,"}
{"text": "The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood"}
{"text": "Which breathed this poison."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Rage must be withstood:"}
{"text": "Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame."}
{"text": "And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,"}
{"text": "The purest treasure mortal times afford"}
{"text": "Is spotless reputation: that away,"}
{"text": "Men are but gilded loam or painted clay."}
{"text": "A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest"}
{"text": "Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast."}
{"text": "Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:"}
{"text": "Take honour from me, and my life is done:"}
{"text": "Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;"}
{"text": "In that I live and for that will I die."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!"}
{"text": "Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?"}
{"text": "Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height"}
{"text": "Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue"}
{"text": "Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,"}
{"text": "Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear"}
{"text": "The slavish motive of recanting fear,"}
{"text": "And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,"}
{"text": "Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "We were not born to sue, but to command;"}
{"text": "Which since we cannot do to make you friends,"}
{"text": "Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,"}
{"text": "At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:"}
{"text": "There shall your swords and lances arbitrate"}
{"text": "The swelling difference of your settled hate:"}
{"text": "Since we can not atone you, we shall see"}
{"text": "Justice design the victor's chivalry."}
{"text": "Lord marshal, command our officers at arms"}
{"text": "Be ready to direct these home alarms."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood"}
{"text": "Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,"}
{"text": "To stir against the butchers of his life!"}
{"text": "But since correction lieth in those hands"}
{"text": "Which made the fault that we cannot correct,"}
{"text": "Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;"}
{"text": "Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,"}
{"text": "Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads."}
{"text": "DUCHESS:"}
{"text": "Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?"}
{"text": "Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?"}
{"text": "Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,"}
{"text": "Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,"}
{"text": "Or seven fair branches springing from one root:"}
{"text": "Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,"}
{"text": "Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;"}
{"text": "But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,"}
{"text": "One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,"}
{"text": "One flourishing branch of his most royal root,"}
{"text": "Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,"}
{"text": "Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,"}
{"text": "By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe."}
{"text": "Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,"}
{"text": "That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee"}
{"text": "Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,"}
{"text": "Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent"}
{"text": "In some large measure to thy father's death,"}
{"text": "In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,"}
{"text": "Who was the model of thy father's life."}
{"text": "Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:"}
{"text": "In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,"}
{"text": "Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,"}
{"text": "Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:"}
{"text": "That which in mean men we intitle patience"}
{"text": "Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts."}
{"text": "What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,"}
{"text": "The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,"}
{"text": "His deputy anointed in His sight,"}
{"text": "Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,"}
{"text": "Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift"}
{"text": "An angry arm against His minister."}
{"text": "DUCHESS:"}
{"text": "Where then, alas, may I complain myself?"}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "To God, the widow's champion and defence."}
{"text": "DUCHESS:"}
{"text": "Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt."}
{"text": "Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold"}
{"text": "Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:"}
{"text": "O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,"}
{"text": "That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!"}
{"text": "Or, if misfortune miss the first career,"}
{"text": "Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,"}
{"text": "They may break his foaming courser's back,"}
{"text": "And throw the rider headlong in the lists,"}
{"text": "A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!"}
{"text": "Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife"}
{"text": "With her companion grief must end her life."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:"}
{"text": "As much good stay with thee as go with me!"}
{"text": "DUCHESS:"}
{"text": "Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,"}
{"text": "Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:"}
{"text": "I take my leave before I have begun,"}
{"text": "For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done."}
{"text": "Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York."}
{"text": "Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;"}
{"text": "Though this be all, do not so quickly go;"}
{"text": "I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--"}
{"text": "With all good speed at Plashy visit me."}
{"text": "Alack, and what shall good old York there see"}
{"text": "But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,"}
{"text": "Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?"}
{"text": "And what hear there for welcome but my groans?"}
{"text": "Therefore commend me; let him not come there,"}
{"text": "To seek out sorrow that dwells every where."}
{"text": "Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:"}
{"text": "The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?"}
{"text": "DUKE OF AUMERLE:"}
{"text": "Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,"}
{"text": "Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet."}
{"text": "DUKE OF AUMERLE:"}
{"text": "Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay"}
{"text": "For nothing but his majesty's approach."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Marshal, demand of yonder champion"}
{"text": "The cause of his arrival here in arms:"}
{"text": "Ask him his name and orderly proceed"}
{"text": "To swear him in the justice of his cause."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "In God's name and the king's, say who thou art"}
{"text": "And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,"}
{"text": "Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:"}
{"text": "Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;"}
{"text": "As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!"}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;"}
{"text": "Who hither come engaged by my oath--"}
{"text": "Which God defend a knight should violate!--"}
{"text": "Both to defend my loyalty and truth"}
{"text": "To God, my king and my succeeding issue,"}
{"text": "Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me"}
{"text": "And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,"}
{"text": "To prove him, in defending of myself,"}
{"text": "A traitor to my God, my king, and me:"}
{"text": "And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,"}
{"text": "Both who he is and why he cometh hither"}
{"text": "Thus plated in habiliments of war,"}
{"text": "And formally, according to our law,"}
{"text": "Depose him in the justice of his cause."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,"}
{"text": "Before King Richard in his royal lists?"}

{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby"}
{"text": "Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,"}
{"text": "To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,"}
{"text": "In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"}
{"text": "That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,"}
{"text": "To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;"}
{"text": "And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!"}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "On pain of death, no person be so bold"}
{"text": "Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,"}
{"text": "Except the marshal and such officers"}
{"text": "Appointed to direct these fair designs."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,"}
{"text": "And bow my knee before his majesty:"}
{"text": "For Mowbray and myself are like two men"}
{"text": "That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;"}
{"text": "Then let us take a ceremonious leave"}
{"text": "And loving farewell of our several friends."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "The appellant in all duty greets your highness,"}
{"text": "And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "We will descend and fold him in our arms."}
{"text": "Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,"}
{"text": "So be thy fortune in this royal fight!"}
{"text": "Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,"}
{"text": "Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "O let no noble eye profane a tear"}
{"text": "For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:"}
{"text": "As confident as is the falcon's flight"}
{"text": "Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight."}
{"text": "My loving lord, I take my leave of you;"}
{"text": "Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;"}
{"text": "Not sick, although I have to do with death,"}
{"text": "But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath."}
{"text": "Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet"}
{"text": "The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:"}
{"text": "O thou, the earthly author of my blood,"}
{"text": "Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,"}
{"text": "Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up"}
{"text": "To reach at victory above my head,"}
{"text": "Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;"}
{"text": "And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,"}
{"text": "That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,"}
{"text": "And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,"}
{"text": "Even in the lusty havior of his son."}
{"text": "JOHN OF GAUNT:"}
{"text": "God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!"}
{"text": "Be swift like lightning in the execution;"}
{"text": "And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,"}
{"text": "Fall like amazing thunder on the casque"}
{"text": "Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:"}
{"text": "Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}

{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "However God or fortune cast my lot,"}
{"text": "There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,"}
{"text": "A loyal, just and upright gentleman:"}
{"text": "Never did captive with a freer heart"}
{"text": "Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace"}
{"text": "His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,"}
{"text": "More than my dancing soul doth celebrate"}
{"text": "This feast of battle with mine adversary."}
{"text": "Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,"}
{"text": "Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:"}
{"text": "As gentle and as jocund as to jest"}
{"text": "Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Farewell, my lord: securely I espy"}
{"text": "Virtue with valour couched in thine eye."}
{"text": "Order the trial, marshal, and begin."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"}
{"text": "Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!"}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk."}
{"text": "First Herald:"}
{"text": "Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"}
{"text": "Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,"}
{"text": "On pain to be found false and recreant,"}
{"text": "To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,"}
{"text": "A traitor to his God, his king and him;"}
{"text": "And dares him to set forward to the fight."}
{"text": "Second Herald:"}
{"text": "Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"}
{"text": "On pain to be found false and recreant,"}
{"text": "Both to defend himself and to approve"}
{"text": "Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,"}
{"text": "To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;"}
{"text": "Courageously and with a free desire"}
{"text": "Attending but the signal to begin."}
{"text": "Lord Marshal:"}
{"text": "Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants."}
{"text": "Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,"}
{"text": "And both return back to their chairs again:"}
{"text": "Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound"}
{"text": "While we return these dukes what we decree."}
{"text": "Draw near,"}
{"text": "And list what with our council we have done."}
{"text": "For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd"}
{"text": "With that dear blood which it hath fostered;"}
{"text": "And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect"}
{"text": "Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;"}
{"text": "And for we think the eagle-winged pride"}
{"text": "Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,"}
{"text": "With rival-hating envy, set on you"}
{"text": "To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle"}
{"text": "Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;"}
{"text": "Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,"}
{"text": "With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,"}
{"text": "And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,"}
{"text": "Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace"}
{"text": "And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,"}
{"text": "Therefore, we banish you our territories:"}
{"text": "You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,"}
{"text": "Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields"}
{"text": "Shall not regreet our fair dominions,"}
{"text": "But tread the stranger paths of banishment."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Your will be done: this must my comfort be,"}
{"text": "Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;"}
{"text": "And those his golden beams to you here lent"}
{"text": "Shall point on me and gild my banishment."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,"}
{"text": "Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:"}
{"text": "The sly slow hours shall not determinate"}
{"text": "The dateless limit of thy dear exile;"}
{"text": "The hopeless word of 'never to return'"}
{"text": "Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,"}
{"text": "And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:"}
{"text": "A dearer merit, not so deep a maim"}
{"text": "As to be cast forth in the common air,"}
{"text": "Have I deserved at your highness' hands."}
{"text": "The language I have learn'd these forty years,"}
{"text": "My native English, now I must forego:"}
{"text": "And now my tongue's use is to me no more"}
{"text": "Than an unstringed viol or a harp,"}
{"text": "Or like a cunning instrument cased up,"}
{"text": "Or, being open, put into his hands"}
{"text": "That knows no touch to tune the harmony:"}
{"text": "Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,"}
{"text": "Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;"}
{"text": "And dull unfeeling barren ignorance"}
{"text": "Is made my gaoler to attend on me."}
{"text": "I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,"}
{"text": "Too far in years to be a pupil now:"}
{"text": "What is thy sentence then but speechless death,"}
{"text": "Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "It boots thee not to be compassionate:"}
{"text": "After our sentence plaining comes too late."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "Then thus I turn me from my country's light,"}
{"text": "To dwell in solemn shades of endless night."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Return again, and take an oath with thee."}
{"text": "Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;"}
{"text": "Swear by the duty that you owe to God--"}
{"text": "Our part therein we banish with yourselves--"}
{"text": "To keep the oath that we administer:"}
{"text": "You never shall, so help you truth and God!"}
{"text": "Embrace each other's love in banishment;"}
{"text": "Nor never look upon each other's face;"}
{"text": "Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile"}
{"text": "This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;"}
{"text": "Nor never by advised purpose meet"}
{"text": "To plot, contrive, or complot any ill"}
{"text": "'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "I swear."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "And I, to keep all this."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--"}
{"text": "By this time, had the king permitted us,"}
{"text": "One of our souls had wander'd in the air."}
{"text": "Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,"}
{"text": "As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:"}
{"text": "Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;"}
{"text": "Since thou hast far to go, bear not along"}
{"text": "The clogging burthen of a guilty soul."}
{"text": "THOMAS MOWBRAY:"}
{"text": "No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,"}
{"text": "My name be blotted from the book of life,"}

{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,"}
{"text": "But basely yielded upon compromise"}
{"text": "That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:"}

{"text": "Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him."}
{"text": "LORD ROSS:"}
{"text": "He hath not money for these Irish wars,"}
{"text": "His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,"}
{"text": "But by the robbing of the banish'd duke."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!"}
{"text": "But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,"}
{"text": "Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;"}
{"text": "We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,"}
{"text": "And yet we strike not, but securely perish."}
{"text": "LORD ROSS:"}
{"text": "We see the very wreck that we must suffer;"}
{"text": "And unavoided is the danger now,"}
{"text": "For suffering so the causes of our wreck."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death"}
{"text": "I spy life peering; but I dare not say"}

{"text": "Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay"}
{"text": "In Brittany, received intelligence"}
{"text": "That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,"}

{"text": "And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:"}

{"text": "Is coming towards me, and my inward soul"}
{"text": "With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,"}
{"text": "More than with parting from my lord the king."}
{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,"}
{"text": "Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;"}
{"text": "For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,"}

{"text": "Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry"}
{"text": "Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,"}

{"text": "Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;"}

{"text": "Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,"}
{"text": "More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;"}
{"text": "Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,"}
{"text": "Which for things true weeps things imaginary."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "It may be so; but yet my inward soul"}
{"text": "Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,"}
{"text": "I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad"}

{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived"}

{"text": "God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:"}
{"text": "I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}

{"text": "For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:"}
{"text": "Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?"}
{"text": "GREEN:"}
{"text": "That he, our hope, might have retired his power,"}
{"text": "And driven into despair an enemy's hope,"}
{"text": "Who strongly hath set footing in this land:"}

{"text": "Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,"}
{"text": "And all the household servants fled with him"}
{"text": "To Bolingbroke."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,"}

{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "Despair not, madam."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "Who shall hinder me?"}
{"text": "I will despair, and be at enmity"}
{"text": "With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,"}

{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!"}
{"text": "The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,"}

{"text": "Servant:"}

{"text": "What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?"}
{"text": "How shall we do for money for these wars?"}
{"text": "Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me."}
{"text": "Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts"}
{"text": "And bring away the armour that is there."}
{"text": "Gentlemen, will you go muster men?"}
{"text": "If I know how or which way to order these affairs"}
{"text": "Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,"}
{"text": "Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:"}
{"text": "The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath"}
{"text": "And duty bids defend; the other again"}
{"text": "Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,"}
{"text": "Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right."}
{"text": "Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll"}
{"text": "Dispose of you."}
{"text": "Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,"}
{"text": "And meet me presently at Berkeley."}
{"text": "I should to Plashy too;"}
{"text": "But time will not permit: all is uneven,"}
{"text": "And every thing is left at six and seven."}
{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,"}
{"text": "But none returns. For us to levy power"}
{"text": "Proportionable to the enemy"}
{"text": "Is all unpossible."}
{"text": "GREEN:"}
{"text": "Besides, our nearness to the king in love"}
{"text": "Is near the hate of those love not the king."}
{"text": "BAGOT:"}
{"text": "And that's the wavering commons: for their love"}
{"text": "Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them"}
{"text": "By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate."}
{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd."}
{"text": "BAGOT:"}
{"text": "If judgement lie in them, then so do we,"}

{"text": "GREEN:"}
{"text": "Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:"}
{"text": "The Earl of Wiltshire is already there."}
{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "Thither will I with you; for little office"}
{"text": "The hateful commons will perform for us,"}
{"text": "Except like curs to tear us all to pieces."}
{"text": "Will you go along with us?"}
{"text": "BAGOT:"}
{"text": "No; I will to Ireland to his majesty."}
{"text": "Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,"}
{"text": "We three here art that ne'er shall meet again."}
{"text": "BUSHY:"}
{"text": "That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke."}
{"text": "GREEN:"}
{"text": "Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes"}
{"text": "Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:"}

{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?"}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Believe me, noble lord,"}
{"text": "I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:"}
{"text": "These high wild hills and rough uneven ways"}
{"text": "Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,"}
{"text": "And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,"}
{"text": "Making the hard way sweet and delectable."}
{"text": "But I bethink me what a weary way"}
{"text": "From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found"}
{"text": "In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,"}
{"text": "Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled"}
{"text": "The tediousness and process of my travel:"}
{"text": "But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have"}
{"text": "The present benefit which I possess;"}
{"text": "And hope to joy is little less in joy"}
{"text": "Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords"}
{"text": "Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done"}
{"text": "By sight of what I have, your noble company."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Of much less value is my company"}
{"text": "Than your good words. But who comes here?"}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "It is my son, young Harry Percy,"}
{"text": "Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever."}
{"text": "Harry, how fares your uncle?"}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Why, is he not with the queen?"}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,"}
{"text": "Broken his staff of office and dispersed"}
{"text": "The household of the king."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "What was his reason?"}
{"text": "He was not so resolved when last we spake together."}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor."}
{"text": "But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,"}
{"text": "To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,"}
{"text": "And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover"}
{"text": "What power the Duke of York had levied there;"}
{"text": "Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?"}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "No, my good lord, for that is not forgot"}
{"text": "Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,"}
{"text": "I never in my life did look on him."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Then learn to know him now; this is the duke."}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "My gracious lord, I tender you my service,"}
{"text": "Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:"}
{"text": "Which elder days shall ripen and confirm"}
{"text": "To more approved service and desert."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure"}
{"text": "I count myself in nothing else so happy"}
{"text": "As in a soul remembering my good friends;"}
{"text": "And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,"}
{"text": "It shall be still thy true love's recompense:"}
{"text": "My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir"}
{"text": "Keeps good old York there with his men of war?"}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,"}
{"text": "Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;"}
{"text": "And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;"}
{"text": "None else of name and noble estimate."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,"}
{"text": "Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues"}
{"text": "A banish'd traitor: all my treasury"}
{"text": "Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd"}
{"text": "Shall be your love and labour's recompense."}
{"text": "LORD ROSS:"}
{"text": "Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord."}
{"text": "LORD WILLOUGHBY:"}
{"text": "And far surmounts our labour to attain it."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;"}
{"text": "Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,"}
{"text": "Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?"}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess."}
{"text": "LORD BERKELEY:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;"}
{"text": "And I am come to seek that name in England;"}
{"text": "And I must find that title in your tongue,"}
{"text": "Before I make reply to aught you say."}
{"text": "LORD BERKELEY:"}
{"text": "Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning"}
{"text": "To raze one title of your honour out:"}
{"text": "To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,"}
{"text": "From the most gracious regent of this land,"}
{"text": "The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on"}
{"text": "To take advantage of the absent time"}
{"text": "And fright our native peace with self-born arms."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "I shall not need transport my words by you;"}
{"text": "Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!"}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,"}
{"text": "Whose duty is deceiveable and false."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "My gracious uncle--"}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Tut, tut!"}
{"text": "Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:"}
{"text": "I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'"}
{"text": "In an ungracious mouth is but profane."}
{"text": "Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs"}
{"text": "Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?"}
{"text": "But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march"}
{"text": "So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,"}
{"text": "Frighting her pale-faced villages with war"}
{"text": "And ostentation of despised arms?"}
{"text": "Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?"}
{"text": "Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,"}
{"text": "And in my loyal bosom lies his power."}
{"text": "Were I but now the lord of such hot youth"}
{"text": "As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself"}
{"text": "Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,"}
{"text": "From forth the ranks of many thousand French,"}
{"text": "O, then how quickly should this arm of mine."}
{"text": "Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee"}
{"text": "And minister correction to thy fault!"}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:"}
{"text": "On what condition stands it and wherein?"}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Even in condition of the worst degree,"}
{"text": "In gross rebellion and detested treason:"}
{"text": "Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come"}
{"text": "Before the expiration of thy time,"}
{"text": "In braving arms against thy sovereign."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;"}
{"text": "But as I come, I come for Lancaster."}
{"text": "And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace"}
{"text": "Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:"}
{"text": "You are my father, for methinks in you"}
{"text": "I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,"}
{"text": "Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd"}
{"text": "A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties"}
{"text": "Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away"}
{"text": "To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?"}
{"text": "If that my cousin king be King of England,"}
{"text": "It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster."}
{"text": "You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;"}
{"text": "Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,"}
{"text": "He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,"}
{"text": "To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay."}
{"text": "I am denied to sue my livery here,"}
{"text": "And yet my letters-patents give me leave:"}
{"text": "My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,"}
{"text": "And these and all are all amiss employ'd."}
{"text": "What would you have me do? I am a subject,"}
{"text": "And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;"}
{"text": "And therefore, personally I lay my claim"}
{"text": "To my inheritance of free descent."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "The noble duke hath been too much abused."}
{"text": "LORD ROSS:"}
{"text": "It stands your grace upon to do him right."}

{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "My lords of England, let me tell you this:"}

{"text": "And laboured all I could to do him right;"}
{"text": "But in this kind to come, in braving arms,"}
{"text": "Be his own carver and cut out his way,"}
{"text": "To find out right with wrong, it may not be;"}
{"text": "And you that do abet him in this kind"}
{"text": "Cherish rebellion and are rebels all."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "The noble duke hath sworn his coming is"}
{"text": "But for his own; and for the right of that"}
{"text": "We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;"}
{"text": "And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!"}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:"}
{"text": "I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,"}
{"text": "Because my power is weak and all ill left:"}
{"text": "But if I could, by Him that gave me life,"}
{"text": "I would attach you all and make you stoop"}
{"text": "Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;"}
{"text": "But since I cannot, be it known to you"}
{"text": "I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;"}

{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "An offer, uncle, that we will accept:"}
{"text": "But we must win your grace to go with us"}
{"text": "To Bristol castle, which they say is held"}
{"text": "By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,"}

{"text": "Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away."}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}

{"text": "Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:"}
{"text": "Things past redress are now with me past care."}
{"text": "Captain:"}
{"text": "My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,"}

{"text": "My gracious lord,--"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee"}
{"text": "To make the base earth proud with kissing it:"}
{"text": "Me rather had my heart might feel your love"}
{"text": "Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy."}
{"text": "Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,"}
{"text": "Thus high at least, although your knee be low."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "My gracious lord, I come but for mine own."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,"}
{"text": "As my true service shall deserve your love."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,"}
{"text": "That know the strong'st and surest way to get."}
{"text": "Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;"}
{"text": "Tears show their love, but want their remedies."}
{"text": "Cousin, I am too young to be your father,"}
{"text": "Though you are old enough to be my heir."}
{"text": "What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;"}
{"text": "For do we must what force will have us do."}
{"text": "Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?"}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Yea, my good lord."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Then I must not say no."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "What sport shall we devise here in this garden,"}

{"text": "'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,"}

{"text": "Lady:"}
{"text": "Madam, we'll tell tales."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "Of sorrow or of joy?"}
{"text": "Lady:"}
{"text": "Of either, madam."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "Of neither, girl:"}
{"text": "For of joy, being altogether wanting,"}
{"text": "It doth remember me the more of sorrow;"}
{"text": "Or if of grief, being altogether had,"}
{"text": "It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:"}
{"text": "For what I have I need not to repeat;"}
{"text": "And what I want it boots not to complain."}
{"text": "Lady:"}
{"text": "Madam, I'll sing."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "'Tis well that thou hast cause"}
{"text": "But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep."}
{"text": "Lady:"}
{"text": "I could weep, madam, would it do you good."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "And I could sing, would weeping do me good,"}
{"text": "And never borrow any tear of thee."}
{"text": "But stay, here come the gardeners:"}
{"text": "Let's step into the shadow of these trees."}
{"text": "My wretchedness unto a row of pins,"}
{"text": "They'll talk of state; for every one doth so"}
{"text": "Against a change; woe is forerun with woe."}
{"text": "Gardener:"}
{"text": "Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,"}
{"text": "Which, like unruly children, make their sire"}
{"text": "Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:"}
{"text": "Give some supportance to the bending twigs."}
{"text": "Go thou, and like an executioner,"}
{"text": "Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,"}
{"text": "That look too lofty in our commonwealth:"}
{"text": "All must be even in our government."}
{"text": "You thus employ'd, I will go root away"}
{"text": "The noisome weeds, which without profit suck"}
{"text": "The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "Why should we in the compass of a pale"}
{"text": "Keep law and form and due proportion,"}
{"text": "Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,"}
{"text": "When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,"}
{"text": "Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,"}

{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "What, are they dead?"}
{"text": "Gardener:"}

{"text": "Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it"}
{"text": "That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land"}
{"text": "As we this garden! We at time of year"}
{"text": "Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,"}
{"text": "Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,"}
{"text": "With too much riches it confound itself:"}
{"text": "Had he done so to great and growing men,"}
{"text": "They might have lived to bear and he to taste"}
{"text": "Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches"}
{"text": "We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:"}
{"text": "Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,"}
{"text": "Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "What, think you then the king shall be deposed?"}
{"text": "Gardener:"}
{"text": "Depress'd he is already, and deposed"}
{"text": "'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night"}
{"text": "To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,"}
{"text": "That tell black tidings."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!"}
{"text": "Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,"}
{"text": "How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?"}

{"text": "To make a second fall of cursed man?"}
{"text": "Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?"}
{"text": "Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,"}
{"text": "Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,"}
{"text": "Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch."}
{"text": "Gardener:"}
{"text": "Pardon me, madam: little joy have I"}
{"text": "To breathe this news; yet what I say is true."}
{"text": "King Richard, he is in the mighty hold"}
{"text": "Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:"}
{"text": "In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,"}
{"text": "And some few vanities that make him light;"}
{"text": "But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,"}
{"text": "Besides himself, are all the English peers,"}
{"text": "And with that odds he weighs King Richard down."}
{"text": "Post you to London, and you will find it so;"}
{"text": "I speak no more than every one doth know."}
{"text": "QUEEN:"}
{"text": "Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,"}
{"text": "Doth not thy embassage belong to me,"}

{"text": "'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech."}
{"text": "I never long'd to hear a word till now;"}
{"text": "Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:"}
{"text": "The word is short, but not so short as sweet;"}
{"text": "No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet."}
{"text": "DUKE OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'"}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?"}
{"text": "Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,"}
{"text": "That set'st the word itself against the word!"}
{"text": "Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;"}
{"text": "The chopping French we do not understand."}
{"text": "Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;"}
{"text": "Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;"}
{"text": "That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,"}
{"text": "Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Good aunt, stand up."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "I do not sue to stand;"}
{"text": "Pardon is all the suit I have in hand."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "I pardon him, as God shall pardon me."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!"}
{"text": "Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;"}
{"text": "Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,"}
{"text": "But makes one pardon strong."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "With all my heart"}
{"text": "I pardon him."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "A god on earth thou art."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,"}
{"text": "With all the rest of that consorted crew,"}
{"text": "Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels."}
{"text": "Good uncle, help to order several powers"}
{"text": "To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:"}
{"text": "They shall not live within this world, I swear,"}
{"text": "But I will have them, if I once know where."}
{"text": "Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:"}
{"text": "Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true."}
{"text": "DUCHESS OF YORK:"}
{"text": "Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,"}
{"text": "'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'"}
{"text": "Was it not so?"}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "These were his very words."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,"}
{"text": "And urged it twice together, did he not?"}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "He did."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,"}
{"text": "And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'"}
{"text": "That would divorce this terror from my heart;'"}
{"text": "Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:"}
{"text": "I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "I have been studying how I may compare"}
{"text": "This prison where I live unto the world:"}
{"text": "And for because the world is populous"}
{"text": "And here is not a creature but myself,"}
{"text": "I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out."}
{"text": "My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,"}
{"text": "My soul the father; and these two beget"}
{"text": "A generation of still-breeding thoughts,"}
{"text": "And these same thoughts people this little world,"}
{"text": "In humours like the people of this world,"}
{"text": "For no thought is contented. The better sort,"}
{"text": "As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd"}
{"text": "With scruples and do set the word itself"}
{"text": "Against the word:"}
{"text": "As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,"}
{"text": "'It is as hard to come as for a camel"}
{"text": "To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'"}
{"text": "Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot"}
{"text": "Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails"}
{"text": "May tear a passage through the flinty ribs"}
{"text": "Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,"}
{"text": "And, for they cannot, die in their own pride."}
{"text": "Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves"}
{"text": "That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,"}
{"text": "Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars"}
{"text": "Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,"}
{"text": "That many have and others must sit there;"}
{"text": "And in this thought they find a kind of ease,"}
{"text": "Bearing their own misfortunes on the back"}
{"text": "Of such as have before endured the like."}
{"text": "Thus play I in one person many people,"}
{"text": "And none contented: sometimes am I king;"}
{"text": "Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,"}
{"text": "And so I am: then crushing penury"}
{"text": "Persuades me I was better when a king;"}
{"text": "Then am I king'd again: and by and by"}
{"text": "Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,"}
{"text": "And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,"}
{"text": "Nor I nor any man that but man is"}
{"text": "With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased"}
{"text": "With being nothing. Music do I hear?"}
{"text": "Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,"}
{"text": "When time is broke and no proportion kept!"}
{"text": "So is it in the music of men's lives."}
{"text": "And here have I the daintiness of ear"}
{"text": "To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;"}
{"text": "But for the concord of my state and time"}
{"text": "Had not an ear to hear my true time broke."}
{"text": "I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;"}
{"text": "For now hath time made me his numbering clock:"}
{"text": "My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar"}
{"text": "Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,"}
{"text": "Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,"}
{"text": "Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears."}
{"text": "Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is"}
{"text": "Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,"}
{"text": "Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans"}
{"text": "Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time"}
{"text": "Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,"}
{"text": "While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock."}
{"text": "This music mads me; let it sound no more;"}
{"text": "For though it have holp madmen to their wits,"}
{"text": "In me it seems it will make wise men mad."}
{"text": "Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!"}
{"text": "For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard"}
{"text": "Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world."}
{"text": "Groom:"}
{"text": "Hail, royal prince!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Thanks, noble peer;"}
{"text": "The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear."}
{"text": "What art thou? and how comest thou hither,"}
{"text": "Where no man never comes but that sad dog"}
{"text": "That brings me food to make misfortune live?"}
{"text": "Groom:"}
{"text": "I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,"}
{"text": "When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,"}
{"text": "With much ado at length have gotten leave"}
{"text": "To look upon my sometimes royal master's face."}
{"text": "O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld"}
{"text": "In London streets, that coronation-day,"}
{"text": "When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,"}
{"text": "That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,"}
{"text": "That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,"}
{"text": "How went he under him?"}
{"text": "Groom:"}
{"text": "So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!"}
{"text": "That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;"}
{"text": "This hand hath made him proud with clapping him."}
{"text": "Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,"}
{"text": "Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck"}
{"text": "Of that proud man that did usurp his back?"}
{"text": "Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,"}
{"text": "Since thou, created to be awed by man,"}
{"text": "Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;"}
{"text": "And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,"}
{"text": "Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke."}
{"text": "Keeper:"}
{"text": "Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away."}
{"text": "Groom:"}
{"text": "What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say."}
{"text": "Keeper:"}
{"text": "My lord, will't please you to fall to?"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do."}
{"text": "Keeper:"}
{"text": "My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who"}
{"text": "lately came from the king, commands the contrary."}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!"}
{"text": "Patience is stale, and I am weary of it."}
{"text": "Keeper:"}
{"text": "Help, help, help!"}
{"text": "KING RICHARD II:"}
{"text": "How now! what means death in this rude assault?"}
{"text": "Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument."}
{"text": "Go thou, and fill another room in hell."}
{"text": "That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire"}
{"text": "That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand"}
{"text": "Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land."}
{"text": "Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;"}
{"text": "Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "As full of valour as of royal blood:"}
{"text": "Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!"}
{"text": "For now the devil, that told me I did well,"}
{"text": "Says that this deed is chronicled in hell."}
{"text": "This dead king to the living king I'll bear"}
{"text": "Take hence the rest, and give them burial here."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear"}
{"text": "Is that the rebels have consumed with fire"}
{"text": "Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;"}
{"text": "But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not."}
{"text": "Welcome, my lord what is the news?"}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness."}
{"text": "The next news is, I have to London sent"}
{"text": "The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:"}
{"text": "The manner of their taking may appear"}
{"text": "At large discoursed in this paper here."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;"}
{"text": "And to thy worth will add right worthy gains."}
{"text": "LORD FITZWATER:"}
{"text": "My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London"}
{"text": "The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,"}
{"text": "Two of the dangerous consorted traitors"}
{"text": "That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;"}
{"text": "Right noble is thy merit, well I wot."}
{"text": "HENRY PERCY:"}
{"text": "The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,"}
{"text": "With clog of conscience and sour melancholy"}
{"text": "Hath yielded up his body to the grave;"}
{"text": "But here is Carlisle living, to abide"}
{"text": "Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Carlisle, this is your doom:"}
{"text": "Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,"}
{"text": "More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;"}
{"text": "So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:"}
{"text": "For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,"}
{"text": "High sparks of honour in thee have I seen."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "Great king, within this coffin I present"}
{"text": "Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies"}
{"text": "The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,"}
{"text": "Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought"}
{"text": "A deed of slander with thy fatal hand"}
{"text": "Upon my head and all this famous land."}
{"text": "EXTON:"}
{"text": "From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed."}
{"text": "HENRY BOLINGBROKE:"}
{"text": "They love not poison that do poison need,"}
{"text": "Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,"}
{"text": "I hate the murderer, love him murdered."}
{"text": "The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,"}
{"text": "But neither my good word nor princely favour:"}
{"text": "With Cain go wander through shades of night,"}
{"text": "And never show thy head by day nor light."}
{"text": "Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,"}
{"text": "That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:"}
{"text": "Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,"}
{"text": "And put on sullen black incontinent:"}
{"text": "I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,"}
{"text": "To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:"}
{"text": "March sadly after; grace my mournings here;"}
{"text": "In weeping after this untimely bier."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "No, for then we should be colliers."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "I strike quickly, being moved."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "But thou art not quickly moved to strike."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "A dog of the house of Montague moves me."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:"}
{"text": "therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will"}
{"text": "take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes"}
{"text": "to the wall."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,"}
{"text": "are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push"}
{"text": "Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids"}
{"text": "to the wall."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "The quarrel is between our masters and us their men."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I"}

{"text": "maids, and cut off their heads."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "The heads of the maids?"}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;"}
{"text": "take it in what sense thou wilt."}
{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "They must take it in sense that feel it."}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and"}

{"text": "GREGORY:"}
{"text": "'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou"}
{"text": "hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes"}

{"text": "SAMPSON:"}
{"text": "Fear me not."}

{"text": "ABRAHAM:"}
{"text": "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"}
{"text": "SAMPSON:"}

{"text": "Or manage it to part these men with me."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,"}
{"text": "As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:"}
{"text": "Have at thee, coward!"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!"}
{"text": "Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,"}
{"text": "And flourishes his blade in spite of me."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go."}
{"text": "LADY MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,"}
{"text": "Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--"}
{"text": "Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,"}
{"text": "That quench the fire of your pernicious rage"}
{"text": "With purple fountains issuing from your veins,"}
{"text": "On pain of torture, from those bloody hands"}
{"text": "Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,"}
{"text": "And hear the sentence of your moved prince."}
{"text": "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,"}
{"text": "By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,"}
{"text": "Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,"}
{"text": "And made Verona's ancient citizens"}
{"text": "Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,"}
{"text": "To wield old partisans, in hands as old,"}
{"text": "Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:"}
{"text": "If ever you disturb our streets again,"}
{"text": "Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace."}
{"text": "For this time, all the rest depart away:"}
{"text": "You Capulet; shall go along with me:"}
{"text": "And, Montague, come you this afternoon,"}
{"text": "To know our further pleasure in this case,"}
{"text": "To old Free-town, our common judgment-place."}
{"text": "Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?"}
{"text": "Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Here were the servants of your adversary,"}
{"text": "And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:"}
{"text": "I drew to part them: in the instant came"}
{"text": "The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,"}
{"text": "Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,"}
{"text": "He swung about his head and cut the winds,"}
{"text": "Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:"}
{"text": "While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,"}
{"text": "Came more and more and fought on part and part,"}
{"text": "Till the prince came, who parted either part."}
{"text": "LADY MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?"}
{"text": "Right glad I am he was not at this fray."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun"}
{"text": "Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,"}
{"text": "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;"}
{"text": "Where, underneath the grove of sycamore"}
{"text": "That westward rooteth from the city's side,"}
{"text": "So early walking did I see your son:"}
{"text": "Towards him I made, but he was ware of me"}
{"text": "And stole into the covert of the wood:"}
{"text": "I, measuring his affections by my own,"}
{"text": "That most are busied when they're most alone,"}
{"text": "Pursued my humour not pursuing his,"}
{"text": "And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Many a morning hath he there been seen,"}
{"text": "With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew."}
{"text": "Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;"}
{"text": "But all so soon as the all-cheering sun"}
{"text": "Should in the furthest east begin to draw"}
{"text": "The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,"}
{"text": "Away from the light steals home my heavy son,"}
{"text": "And private in his chamber pens himself,"}
{"text": "Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out"}
{"text": "And makes himself an artificial night:"}
{"text": "Black and portentous must this humour prove,"}
{"text": "Unless good counsel may the cause remove."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "I neither know it nor can learn of him."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Have you importuned him by any means?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Both by myself and many other friends:"}
{"text": "But he, his own affections' counsellor,"}
{"text": "Is to himself--I will not say how true--"}
{"text": "But to himself so secret and so close,"}
{"text": "So far from sounding and discovery,"}
{"text": "As is the bud bit with an envious worm,"}
{"text": "Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,"}
{"text": "Or dedicate his beauty to the sun."}
{"text": "Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow."}
{"text": "We would as willingly give cure as know."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;"}
{"text": "I'll know his grievance, or be much denied."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,"}
{"text": "To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Good-morrow, cousin."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Is the day so young?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "But new struck nine."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Ay me! sad hours seem long."}
{"text": "Was that my father that went hence so fast?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Not having that, which, having, makes them short."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "In love?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Out--"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Of love?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Out of her favour, where I am in love."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,"}
{"text": "Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,"}
{"text": "Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"}
{"text": "Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?"}
{"text": "Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all."}
{"text": "Here's much to do with hate, but more with love."}
{"text": "Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!"}
{"text": "O any thing, of nothing first create!"}
{"text": "O heavy lightness! serious vanity!"}
{"text": "Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!"}
{"text": "Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,"}
{"text": "sick health!"}
{"text": "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!"}
{"text": "This love feel I, that feel no love in this."}
{"text": "Dost thou not laugh?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "No, coz, I rather weep."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Good heart, at what?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "At thy good heart's oppression."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}

{"text": "Not so big as a round little worm"}
{"text": "Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;"}
{"text": "Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut"}
{"text": "Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,"}
{"text": "Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers."}
{"text": "And in this state she gallops night by night"}

{"text": "Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:"}
{"text": "Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,"}
{"text": "And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;"}

{"text": "Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon"}
{"text": "Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,"}
{"text": "And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two"}
{"text": "And sleeps again. This is that very Mab"}
{"text": "That plats the manes of horses in the night,"}
{"text": "And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,"}
{"text": "Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:"}
{"text": "This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,"}

{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him"}
{"text": "To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle"}
{"text": "Of some strange nature, letting it there stand"}

{"text": "That were some spite: my invocation"}

{"text": "I conjure only but to raise up him."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,"}
{"text": "To be consorted with the humorous night:"}
{"text": "Blind is his love and best befits the dark."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark."}
{"text": "Now will he sit under a medlar tree,"}
{"text": "And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit"}
{"text": "As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone."}
{"text": "Romeo, that she were, O, that she were"}
{"text": "An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!"}
{"text": "Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;"}
{"text": "This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:"}
{"text": "Come, shall we go?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Go, then; for 'tis in vain"}
{"text": "To seek him here that means not to be found."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "He jests at scars that never felt a wound."}
{"text": "But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?"}
{"text": "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."}
{"text": "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,"}
{"text": "Who is already sick and pale with grief,"}
{"text": "That thou her maid art far more fair than she:"}
{"text": "Be not her maid, since she is envious;"}
{"text": "Her vestal livery is but sick and green"}
{"text": "And none but fools do wear it; cast it off."}
{"text": "It is my lady, O, it is my love!"}
{"text": "O, that she knew she were!"}
{"text": "She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?"}
{"text": "Her eye discourses; I will answer it."}
{"text": "I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:"}
{"text": "Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,"}
{"text": "Having some business, do entreat her eyes"}
{"text": "To twinkle in their spheres till they return."}
{"text": "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?"}
{"text": "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,"}
{"text": "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven"}
{"text": "Would through the airy region stream so bright"}
{"text": "That birds would sing and think it were not night."}
{"text": "See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!"}
{"text": "O, that I were a glove upon that hand,"}
{"text": "That I might touch that cheek!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Ay me!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "She speaks:"}
{"text": "O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art"}
{"text": "As glorious to this night, being o'er my head"}
{"text": "As is a winged messenger of heaven"}
{"text": "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes"}
{"text": "Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him"}
{"text": "When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds"}
{"text": "And sails upon the bosom of the air."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?"}
{"text": "Deny thy father and refuse thy name;"}
{"text": "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,"}
{"text": "And I'll no longer be a Capulet."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;"}
{"text": "Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."}
{"text": "What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,"}
{"text": "Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part"}
{"text": "Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!"}
{"text": "What's in a name? that which we call a rose"}
{"text": "By any other name would smell as sweet;"}
{"text": "So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,"}
{"text": "Retain that dear perfection which he owes"}
{"text": "Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,"}
{"text": "And for that name which is no part of thee"}
{"text": "Take all myself."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I take thee at thy word:"}
{"text": "Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;"}
{"text": "Henceforth I never will be Romeo."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night"}
{"text": "So stumblest on my counsel?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "By a name"}
{"text": "I know not how to tell thee who I am:"}
{"text": "My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,"}
{"text": "Because it is an enemy to thee;"}
{"text": "Had I it written, I would tear the word."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words"}
{"text": "Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:"}
{"text": "Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"}
{"text": "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,"}
{"text": "And the place death, considering who thou art,"}
{"text": "If any of my kinsmen find thee here."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;"}
{"text": "For stony limits cannot hold love out,"}
{"text": "And what love can do that dares love attempt;"}
{"text": "Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "If they do see thee, they will murder thee."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye"}
{"text": "Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,"}
{"text": "And I am proof against their enmity."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I would not for the world they saw thee here."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;"}
{"text": "And but thou love me, let them find me here:"}
{"text": "My life were better ended by their hate,"}
{"text": "Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "By whose direction found'st thou out this place?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;"}
{"text": "He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes."}
{"text": "I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far"}
{"text": "As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,"}
{"text": "I would adventure for such merchandise."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,"}
{"text": "Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek"}
{"text": "For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night"}
{"text": "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"}
{"text": "What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!"}
{"text": "Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'"}
{"text": "And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,"}
{"text": "Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries"}
{"text": "Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,"}
{"text": "If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:"}
{"text": "Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,"}
{"text": "I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,"}
{"text": "So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world."}
{"text": "In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,"}
{"text": "And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:"}
{"text": "But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true"}
{"text": "Than those that have more cunning to be strange."}
{"text": "I should have been more strange, I must confess,"}
{"text": "But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,"}
{"text": "My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,"}
{"text": "And not impute this yielding to light love,"}
{"text": "Which the dark night hath so discovered."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear"}
{"text": "That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,"}
{"text": "That monthly changes in her circled orb,"}
{"text": "Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "What shall I swear by?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Do not swear at all;"}
{"text": "Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,"}
{"text": "Which is the god of my idolatry,"}
{"text": "And I'll believe thee."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "If my heart's dear love--"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,"}
{"text": "I have no joy of this contract to-night:"}
{"text": "It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;"}
{"text": "Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be"}
{"text": "Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!"}
{"text": "This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,"}
{"text": "May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet."}
{"text": "Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest"}
{"text": "Come to thy heart as that within my breast!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:"}
{"text": "And yet I would it were to give again."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "But to be frank, and give it thee again."}
{"text": "And yet I wish but for the thing I have:"}
{"text": "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,"}
{"text": "My love as deep; the more I give to thee,"}
{"text": "The more I have, for both are infinite."}
{"text": "I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!"}
{"text": "Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true."}
{"text": "Stay but a little, I will come again."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard."}
{"text": "Being in night, all this is but a dream,"}
{"text": "Too flattering-sweet to be substantial."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed."}
{"text": "If that thy bent of love be honourable,"}
{"text": "Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,"}
{"text": "By one that I'll procure to come to thee,"}
{"text": "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;"}
{"text": "And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay"}
{"text": "And follow thee my lord throughout the world."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,"}
{"text": "I do beseech thee--"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "By and by, I come:--"}
{"text": "To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:"}
{"text": "To-morrow will I send."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "So thrive my soul--"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "A thousand times good night!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "A thousand times the worse, to want thy light."}
{"text": "Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from"}
{"text": "their books,"}
{"text": "But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,"}
{"text": "To lure this tassel-gentle back again!"}
{"text": "Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;"}
{"text": "Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,"}
{"text": "And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,"}
{"text": "With repetition of my Romeo's name."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "It is my soul that calls upon my name:"}
{"text": "How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,"}
{"text": "Like softest music to attending ears!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Romeo!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "My dear?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}

{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:"}
{"text": "And yet no further than a wanton's bird;"}
{"text": "Who lets it hop a little from her hand,"}
{"text": "Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,"}
{"text": "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,"}
{"text": "So loving-jealous of his liberty."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I would I were thy bird."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Sweet, so would I:"}

{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?"}

{"text": "encounter Tybalt?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Why, what is Tybalt?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is"}
{"text": "the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as"}
{"text": "you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and"}
{"text": "proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and"}
{"text": "the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk"}
{"text": "button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the"}
{"text": "very first house, of the first and second cause:"}

{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "The what?"}

{"text": "The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in"}

{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "That's as much as to say, such a case as yours"}

{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Meaning, to court'sy."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Thou hast most kindly hit it."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}

{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Why, then is my pump well flowered."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast"}
{"text": "worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it"}

{"text": "singleness."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have"}

{"text": "thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:"}
{"text": "was I with you there for the goose?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast"}

{"text": "Nay, good goose, bite not."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most"}

{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an"}
{"text": "inch narrow to an ell broad!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added"}
{"text": "to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?"}
{"text": "now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art"}
{"text": "thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:"}
{"text": "for this drivelling love is like a great natural,"}

{"text": "Stop there, stop there."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:"}
{"text": "for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and"}
{"text": "meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Here's goodly gear!"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "A sail, a sail!"}

{"text": "Is it good den?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the"}
{"text": "dial is now upon the prick of noon."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Out upon you! what a man are you!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to"}
{"text": "mar."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'"}
{"text": "quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I"}
{"text": "may find the young Romeo?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when"}
{"text": "you have found him than he was when you sought him:"}
{"text": "I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "You say well."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;"}
{"text": "wisely, wisely."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with"}
{"text": "you."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "She will indite him to some supper."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "What hast thou found?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,"}
{"text": "that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent."}
{"text": "An old hare hoar,"}
{"text": "And an old hare hoar,"}
{"text": "Is very good meat in lent"}
{"text": "But a hare that is hoar"}
{"text": "Is too much for a score,"}
{"text": "When it hoars ere it be spent."}
{"text": "Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll"}
{"text": "to dinner, thither."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I will follow you."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,"}
{"text": "'lady, lady, lady.'"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy"}
{"text": "merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,"}
{"text": "and will speak more in a minute than he will stand"}
{"text": "to in a month."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him"}
{"text": "down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such"}
{"text": "Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall."}
{"text": "Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am"}
{"text": "none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by"}
{"text": "too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?"}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon"}
{"text": "should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare"}
{"text": "draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a"}
{"text": "good quarrel, and the law on my side."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about"}
{"text": "me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:"}
{"text": "and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you"}
{"text": "out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:"}
{"text": "but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into"}
{"text": "a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross"}
{"text": "kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman"}
{"text": "is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double"}
{"text": "with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered"}
{"text": "to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I"}
{"text": "protest unto thee--"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:"}
{"text": "Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as"}
{"text": "I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Bid her devise"}
{"text": "Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;"}
{"text": "And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell"}
{"text": "Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "No truly sir; not a penny."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Go to; I say you shall."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:"}
{"text": "Within this hour my man shall be with thee"}
{"text": "And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;"}
{"text": "Which to the high top-gallant of my joy"}
{"text": "Must be my convoy in the secret night."}
{"text": "Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:"}
{"text": "Farewell; commend me to thy mistress."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "What say'st thou, my dear nurse?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,"}
{"text": "Two may keep counsel, putting one away?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel."}
{"text": "NURSE:"}
{"text": "Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,"}
{"text": "Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there"}
{"text": "is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain"}
{"text": "lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief"}
{"text": "see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her"}
{"text": "sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer"}
{"text": "man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks"}
{"text": "as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not"}
{"text": "rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for"}
{"text": "the--No; I know it begins with some other"}
{"text": "letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of"}
{"text": "it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good"}
{"text": "to hear it."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Commend me to thy lady."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ay, a thousand times."}
{"text": "Peter!"}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "Anon!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;"}
{"text": "In half an hour she promised to return."}
{"text": "Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so."}
{"text": "O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,"}
{"text": "Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,"}
{"text": "Driving back shadows over louring hills:"}
{"text": "Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,"}
{"text": "And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings."}
{"text": "Now is the sun upon the highmost hill"}
{"text": "Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve"}
{"text": "Is three long hours, yet she is not come."}
{"text": "Had she affections and warm youthful blood,"}
{"text": "She would be as swift in motion as a ball;"}
{"text": "My words would bandy her to my sweet love,"}
{"text": "And his to me:"}
{"text": "But old folks, many feign as they were dead;"}
{"text": "Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead."}
{"text": "O God, she comes!"}
{"text": "O honey nurse, what news?"}
{"text": "Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Peter, stay at the gate."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?"}
{"text": "Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;"}
{"text": "If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news"}
{"text": "By playing it to me with so sour a face."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:"}
{"text": "Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:"}
{"text": "Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?"}
{"text": "Do you not see that I am out of breath?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath"}
{"text": "To say to me that thou art out of breath?"}
{"text": "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay"}
{"text": "Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse."}
{"text": "Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;"}
{"text": "Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:"}
{"text": "Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not"}
{"text": "how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his"}
{"text": "face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels"}
{"text": "all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,"}
{"text": "though they be not to be talked on, yet they are"}
{"text": "past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,"}
{"text": "but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy"}
{"text": "ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "No, no: but all this did I know before."}
{"text": "What says he of our marriage? what of that?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!"}
{"text": "It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces."}
{"text": "My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!"}
{"text": "Beshrew your heart for sending me about,"}
{"text": "To catch my death with jaunting up and down!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well."}
{"text": "Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a"}
{"text": "courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I"}
{"text": "warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Where is my mother! why, she is within;"}
{"text": "Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!"}
{"text": "'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"}
{"text": "Where is your mother?'"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O God's lady dear!"}
{"text": "Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;"}
{"text": "Is this the poultice for my aching bones?"}
{"text": "Henceforward do your messages yourself."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I have."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;"}
{"text": "There stays a husband to make you a wife:"}
{"text": "Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,"}
{"text": "They'll be in scarlet straight at any news."}
{"text": "Hie you to church; I must another way,"}
{"text": "To fetch a ladder, by the which your love"}
{"text": "Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:"}
{"text": "I am the drudge and toil in your delight,"}
{"text": "But you shall bear the burden soon at night."}
{"text": "Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "So smile the heavens upon this holy act,"}
{"text": "That after hours with sorrow chide us not!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,"}
{"text": "It cannot countervail the exchange of joy"}
{"text": "That one short minute gives me in her sight:"}
{"text": "Do thou but close our hands with holy words,"}
{"text": "Then love-devouring death do what he dare;"}
{"text": "It is enough I may but call her mine."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "These violent delights have violent ends"}
{"text": "And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,"}
{"text": "Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey"}
{"text": "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness"}
{"text": "And in the taste confounds the appetite:"}
{"text": "Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;"}
{"text": "Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow."}

{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:"}
{"text": "The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,"}
{"text": "And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;"}
{"text": "For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Thou art like one of those fellows that when he"}
{"text": "enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword"}
{"text": "upon the table and says 'God send me no need of"}
{"text": "thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws"}
{"text": "it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Am I like such a fellow?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as"}

{"text": "soon moody to be moved."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "And what to?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, an there were two such, we should have none"}
{"text": "shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,"}
{"text": "thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,"}
{"text": "or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou"}
{"text": "wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no"}
{"text": "other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what"}
{"text": "eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?"}
{"text": "Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of"}

{"text": "didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing"}
{"text": "his new doublet before Easter? with another, for"}

{"text": "wilt tutor me from quarrelling!"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man"}

{"text": "The fee-simple! O simple!"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "By my head, here come the Capulets."}

{"text": "By my heel, I care not."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "Follow me close, for I will speak to them."}
{"text": "Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "And but one word with one of us? couple it with"}
{"text": "something; make it a word and a blow."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you"}

{"text": "Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--"}

{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "We talk here in the public haunt of men:"}

{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:"}
{"text": "Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;"}
{"text": "Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'"}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford"}
{"text": "No better term than this,--thou art a villain."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee"}
{"text": "Doth much excuse the appertaining rage"}
{"text": "To such a greeting: villain am I none;"}
{"text": "Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries"}
{"text": "That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I do protest, I never injured thee,"}
{"text": "But love thee better than thou canst devise,"}

{"text": "Alla stoccata carries it away."}
{"text": "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?"}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "What wouldst thou have with me?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine"}
{"text": "lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you"}
{"text": "shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the"}
{"text": "eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher"}
{"text": "by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your"}
{"text": "ears ere it be out."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "I am for you."}

{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "I am hurt."}
{"text": "A plague o' both your houses! I am sped."}
{"text": "Is he gone, and hath nothing?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "What, art thou hurt?"}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough."}
{"text": "Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a"}
{"text": "church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for"}
{"text": "me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I"}
{"text": "am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'"}
{"text": "both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a"}
{"text": "cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a"}
{"text": "rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of"}

{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I thought all for the best."}
{"text": "MERCUTIO:"}
{"text": "Help me into some house, Benvolio,"}
{"text": "Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!"}
{"text": "They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,"}
{"text": "And soundly too: your houses!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "This gentleman, the prince's near ally,"}

{"text": "With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour"}
{"text": "Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,"}
{"text": "Thy beauty hath made me effeminate"}
{"text": "And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}

{"text": "That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,"}
{"text": "Which too untimely here did scorn the earth."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}

{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Here comes the furious Tybalt back again."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!"}
{"text": "Away to heaven, respective lenity,"}
{"text": "And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!"}
{"text": "Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,"}
{"text": "That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul"}
{"text": "Is but a little way above our heads,"}
{"text": "Staying for thine to keep him company:"}
{"text": "Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him."}
{"text": "TYBALT:"}
{"text": "Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,"}
{"text": "Shalt with him hence."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "This shall determine that."}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Romeo, away, be gone!"}

{"text": "If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "O, I am fortune's fool!"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Why dost thou stay?"}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?"}
{"text": "Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "There lies that Tybalt."}
{"text": "First Citizen:"}
{"text": "Up, sir, go with me;"}
{"text": "I charge thee in the princes name, obey."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "Where are the vile beginners of this fray?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "O noble prince, I can discover all"}
{"text": "The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:"}
{"text": "There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,"}
{"text": "That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!"}
{"text": "O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt"}
{"text": "O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,"}
{"text": "For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague."}
{"text": "O cousin, cousin!"}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?"}
{"text": "BENVOLIO:"}
{"text": "Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;"}
{"text": "Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink"}
{"text": "How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal"}
{"text": "Your high displeasure: all this uttered"}
{"text": "With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,"}
{"text": "Could not take truce with the unruly spleen"}
{"text": "Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts"}
{"text": "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,"}
{"text": "Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,"}
{"text": "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats"}
{"text": "Cold death aside, and with the other sends"}
{"text": "It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,"}
{"text": "Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,"}
{"text": "'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than"}
{"text": "his tongue,"}
{"text": "His agile arm beats down their fatal points,"}
{"text": "And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm"}
{"text": "An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life"}
{"text": "Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;"}
{"text": "But by and by comes back to Romeo,"}
{"text": "Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,"}
{"text": "And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I"}
{"text": "Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain."}
{"text": "And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly."}
{"text": "This is the truth, or let Benvolio die."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "He is a kinsman to the Montague;"}
{"text": "Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:"}
{"text": "Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,"}
{"text": "And all those twenty could but kill one life."}
{"text": "I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;"}
{"text": "Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;"}
{"text": "Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;"}
{"text": "His fault concludes but what the law should end,"}
{"text": "The life of Tybalt."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "And for that offence"}
{"text": "Immediately we do exile him hence:"}
{"text": "I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,"}
{"text": "My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;"}
{"text": "But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine"}
{"text": "That you shall all repent the loss of mine:"}
{"text": "I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;"}
{"text": "Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:"}
{"text": "Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,"}
{"text": "Else, when he's found, that hour is his last."}
{"text": "Bear hence this body and attend our will:"}
{"text": "Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,"}
{"text": "Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner"}
{"text": "As Phaethon would whip you to the west,"}
{"text": "And bring in cloudy night immediately."}
{"text": "Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,"}
{"text": "That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo"}
{"text": "Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."}
{"text": "Lovers can see to do their amorous rites"}
{"text": "By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,"}
{"text": "It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,"}
{"text": "Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,"}
{"text": "And learn me how to lose a winning match,"}
{"text": "Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:"}
{"text": "Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,"}
{"text": "With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,"}
{"text": "Think true love acted simple modesty."}
{"text": "Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;"}
{"text": "For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night"}
{"text": "Whiter than new snow on a raven's back."}
{"text": "Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,"}
{"text": "Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,"}
{"text": "Take him and cut him out in little stars,"}
{"text": "And he will make the face of heaven so fine"}
{"text": "That all the world will be in love with night"}
{"text": "And pay no worship to the garish sun."}
{"text": "O, I have bought the mansion of a love,"}
{"text": "But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,"}
{"text": "Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day"}
{"text": "As is the night before some festival"}
{"text": "To an impatient child that hath new robes"}
{"text": "And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,"}
{"text": "And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks"}
{"text": "But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence."}
{"text": "Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords"}
{"text": "That Romeo bid thee fetch?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ay, ay, the cords."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!"}
{"text": "We are undone, lady, we are undone!"}
{"text": "Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Can heaven be so envious?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Romeo can,"}
{"text": "Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!"}
{"text": "Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?"}
{"text": "This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell."}
{"text": "Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'"}
{"text": "And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more"}
{"text": "Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:"}
{"text": "I am not I, if there be such an I;"}
{"text": "Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'"}
{"text": "If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:"}
{"text": "Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--"}
{"text": "God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:"}
{"text": "A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;"}
{"text": "Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,"}
{"text": "All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!"}
{"text": "To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!"}
{"text": "Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;"}
{"text": "And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!"}
{"text": "O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!"}
{"text": "That ever I should live to see thee dead!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What storm is this that blows so contrary?"}
{"text": "Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?"}
{"text": "My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?"}
{"text": "Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!"}
{"text": "For who is living, if those two are gone?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;"}
{"text": "Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "It did, it did; alas the day, it did!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!"}
{"text": "Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?"}
{"text": "Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!"}
{"text": "Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!"}
{"text": "Despised substance of divinest show!"}
{"text": "Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,"}
{"text": "A damned saint, an honourable villain!"}
{"text": "O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,"}
{"text": "When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend"}
{"text": "In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?"}
{"text": "Was ever book containing such vile matter"}
{"text": "So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell"}
{"text": "In such a gorgeous palace!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "There's no trust,"}
{"text": "No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,"}
{"text": "All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers."}
{"text": "Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:"}
{"text": "These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old."}
{"text": "Shame come to Romeo!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Blister'd be thy tongue"}
{"text": "For such a wish! he was not born to shame:"}
{"text": "Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;"}
{"text": "For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd"}
{"text": "Sole monarch of the universal earth."}
{"text": "O, what a beast was I to chide at him!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?"}
{"text": "Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,"}
{"text": "When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?"}
{"text": "But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?"}
{"text": "That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:"}
{"text": "Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;"}
{"text": "Your tributary drops belong to woe,"}
{"text": "Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy."}
{"text": "My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;"}
{"text": "And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:"}
{"text": "All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?"}
{"text": "Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,"}
{"text": "That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;"}
{"text": "But, O, it presses to my memory,"}
{"text": "Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:"}
{"text": "'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'"}
{"text": "That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'"}
{"text": "Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death"}
{"text": "Was woe enough, if it had ended there:"}
{"text": "Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship"}
{"text": "And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,"}
{"text": "Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'"}
{"text": "Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,"}
{"text": "Which modern lamentations might have moved?"}
{"text": "But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,"}
{"text": "'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,"}
{"text": "Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,"}
{"text": "All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'"}
{"text": "There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,"}
{"text": "In that word's death; no words can that woe sound."}

{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:"}
{"text": "Will you go to them? I will bring you thither."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,"}
{"text": "When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment."}
{"text": "Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,"}
{"text": "Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:"}
{"text": "He made you for a highway to my bed;"}
{"text": "But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed."}
{"text": "Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;"}
{"text": "And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo"}
{"text": "To comfort you: I wot well where he is."}
{"text": "Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:"}
{"text": "I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell."}

{"text": "And thou art wedded to calamity."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?"}
{"text": "What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,"}
{"text": "That I yet know not?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Too familiar"}
{"text": "Is my dear son with such sour company:"}
{"text": "I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,"}
{"text": "Not body's death, but body's banishment."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'"}
{"text": "For exile hath more terror in his look,"}
{"text": "Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hence from Verona art thou banished:"}
{"text": "Be patient, for the world is broad and wide."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "There is no world without Verona walls,"}
{"text": "But purgatory, torture, hell itself."}
{"text": "Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,"}
{"text": "And world's exile is death: then banished,"}
{"text": "Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,"}
{"text": "Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,"}
{"text": "And smilest upon the stroke that murders me."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!"}
{"text": "Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,"}
{"text": "Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,"}
{"text": "And turn'd that black word death to banishment:"}

{"text": "But Romeo may not: more validity,"}
{"text": "More honourable state, more courtship lives"}
{"text": "In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize"}
{"text": "On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand"}
{"text": "And steal immortal blessing from her lips,"}
{"text": "Who even in pure and vestal modesty,"}
{"text": "Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;"}
{"text": "But Romeo may not; he is banished:"}
{"text": "Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:"}
{"text": "They are free men, but I am banished."}
{"text": "And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?"}
{"text": "Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,"}
{"text": "No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,"}
{"text": "But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?"}
{"text": "O friar, the damned use that word in hell;"}
{"text": "Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,"}
{"text": "Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,"}
{"text": "A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,"}
{"text": "To mangle me with that word 'banished'?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "O, thou wilt speak again of banishment."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:"}
{"text": "Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,"}
{"text": "To comfort thee, though thou art banished."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!"}
{"text": "Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,"}
{"text": "Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,"}
{"text": "It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "O, then I see that madmen have no ears."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Let me dispute with thee of thy estate."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:"}
{"text": "Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,"}
{"text": "An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,"}
{"text": "Doting like me and like me banished,"}
{"text": "Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,"}
{"text": "And fall upon the ground, as I do now,"}
{"text": "Taking the measure of an unmade grave."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,"}
{"text": "Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;"}
{"text": "Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;"}
{"text": "Run to my study. By and by! God's will,"}
{"text": "What simpleness is this! I come, I come!"}
{"text": "Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Welcome, then."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,"}
{"text": "Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O, he is even in my mistress' case,"}
{"text": "Just in her case! O woful sympathy!"}
{"text": "Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,"}
{"text": "Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."}
{"text": "Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:"}
{"text": "For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;"}
{"text": "Why should you fall into so deep an O?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Nurse!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?"}
{"text": "Doth she not think me an old murderer,"}
{"text": "Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy"}
{"text": "With blood removed but little from her own?"}
{"text": "Where is she? and how doth she? and what says"}
{"text": "My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;"}
{"text": "And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,"}
{"text": "And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,"}
{"text": "And then down falls again."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "As if that name,"}
{"text": "Shot from the deadly level of a gun,"}
{"text": "Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand"}
{"text": "Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,"}
{"text": "In what vile part of this anatomy"}
{"text": "Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack"}
{"text": "The hateful mansion."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hold thy desperate hand:"}
{"text": "Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:"}
{"text": "Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote"}
{"text": "The unreasonable fury of a beast:"}
{"text": "Unseemly woman in a seeming man!"}
{"text": "Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!"}
{"text": "Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,"}
{"text": "I thought thy disposition better temper'd."}
{"text": "Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?"}
{"text": "And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,"}
{"text": "By doing damned hate upon thyself?"}
{"text": "Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?"}
{"text": "Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet"}
{"text": "In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose."}
{"text": "Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;"}
{"text": "Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,"}
{"text": "And usest none in that true use indeed"}
{"text": "Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:"}
{"text": "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,"}
{"text": "Digressing from the valour of a man;"}
{"text": "Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,"}
{"text": "Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;"}
{"text": "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,"}
{"text": "Misshapen in the conduct of them both,"}
{"text": "Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,"}
{"text": "Is set afire by thine own ignorance,"}
{"text": "And thou dismember'd with thine own defence."}
{"text": "What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,"}
{"text": "For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;"}
{"text": "There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,"}
{"text": "But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:"}
{"text": "The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend"}
{"text": "And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:"}
{"text": "A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;"}
{"text": "Happiness courts thee in her best array;"}
{"text": "But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,"}
{"text": "Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:"}
{"text": "Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable."}
{"text": "Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,"}
{"text": "Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:"}
{"text": "But look thou stay not till the watch be set,"}
{"text": "For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;"}
{"text": "Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time"}
{"text": "To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,"}
{"text": "Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back"}
{"text": "With twenty hundred thousand times more joy"}
{"text": "Than thou went'st forth in lamentation."}
{"text": "Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;"}
{"text": "And bid her hasten all the house to bed,"}
{"text": "Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:"}
{"text": "Romeo is coming."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night"}
{"text": "To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!"}
{"text": "My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:"}
{"text": "Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "How well my comfort is revived by this!"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:"}
{"text": "Either be gone before the watch be set,"}
{"text": "Or by the break of day disguised from hence:"}
{"text": "Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,"}
{"text": "And he shall signify from time to time"}
{"text": "Every good hap to you that chances here:"}
{"text": "Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "But that a joy past joy calls out on me,"}
{"text": "It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,"}
{"text": "That we have had no time to move our daughter:"}
{"text": "Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,"}
{"text": "And so did I:--Well, we were born to die."}
{"text": "'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:"}
{"text": "I promise you, but for your company,"}
{"text": "I would have been a-bed an hour ago."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "These times of woe afford no time to woo."}
{"text": "Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;"}
{"text": "To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender"}
{"text": "Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled"}
{"text": "In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not."}
{"text": "Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;"}
{"text": "Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;"}
{"text": "And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--"}
{"text": "But, soft! what day is this?"}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Monday, my lord,"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,"}
{"text": "O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,"}
{"text": "She shall be married to this noble earl."}
{"text": "Will you be ready? do you like this haste?"}
{"text": "We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;"}
{"text": "For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,"}
{"text": "It may be thought we held him carelessly,"}
{"text": "Being our kinsman, if we revel much:"}
{"text": "Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,"}
{"text": "And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?"}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then."}
{"text": "Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,"}
{"text": "Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day."}
{"text": "Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!"}
{"text": "Afore me! it is so very very late,"}
{"text": "That we may call it early by and by."}
{"text": "Good night."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:"}
{"text": "It was the nightingale, and not the lark,"}
{"text": "That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;"}
{"text": "Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:"}
{"text": "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "It was the lark, the herald of the morn,"}
{"text": "No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks"}
{"text": "Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:"}
{"text": "Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day"}
{"text": "Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."}
{"text": "I must be gone and live, or stay and die."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:"}
{"text": "It is some meteor that the sun exhales,"}
{"text": "To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,"}
{"text": "And light thee on thy way to Mantua:"}
{"text": "Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;"}
{"text": "I am content, so thou wilt have it so."}
{"text": "I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,"}
{"text": "'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;"}
{"text": "Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat"}
{"text": "The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:"}
{"text": "I have more care to stay than will to go:"}
{"text": "Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so."}
{"text": "How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!"}
{"text": "It is the lark that sings so out of tune,"}
{"text": "Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps."}
{"text": "Some say the lark makes sweet division;"}
{"text": "This doth not so, for she divideth us:"}
{"text": "Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,"}
{"text": "O, now I would they had changed voices too!"}
{"text": "Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,"}
{"text": "Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,"}
{"text": "O, now be gone; more light and light it grows."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Madam!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Nurse?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:"}
{"text": "The day is broke; be wary, look about."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Then, window, let day in, and let life out."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!"}
{"text": "I must hear from thee every day in the hour,"}
{"text": "For in a minute there are many days:"}
{"text": "O, by this count I shall be much in years"}
{"text": "Ere I again behold my Romeo!"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "Farewell!"}
{"text": "I will omit no opportunity"}
{"text": "That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?"}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve"}
{"text": "For sweet discourses in our time to come."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O God, I have an ill-divining soul!"}
{"text": "Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,"}
{"text": "As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:"}
{"text": "Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale."}
{"text": "ROMEO:"}
{"text": "And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:"}
{"text": "Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:"}
{"text": "If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him."}
{"text": "That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;"}
{"text": "For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,"}
{"text": "But send him back."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?"}
{"text": "Is she not down so late, or up so early?"}
{"text": "What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, Juliet!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Madam, I am not well."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?"}
{"text": "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?"}
{"text": "An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;"}
{"text": "Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;"}
{"text": "But much of grief shows still some want of wit."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend"}
{"text": "Which you weep for."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Feeling so the loss,"}
{"text": "Cannot choose but ever weep the friend."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,"}
{"text": "As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What villain madam?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "That same villain, Romeo."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "That is, because the traitor murderer lives."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:"}
{"text": "Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:"}
{"text": "Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,"}
{"text": "Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,"}
{"text": "Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,"}
{"text": "That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:"}
{"text": "And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Indeed, I never shall be satisfied"}
{"text": "With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--"}
{"text": "Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd."}
{"text": "Madam, if you could find out but a man"}
{"text": "To bear a poison, I would temper it;"}
{"text": "That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,"}
{"text": "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors"}
{"text": "To hear him named, and cannot come to him."}
{"text": "To wreak the love I bore my cousin"}
{"text": "Upon his body that slaughter'd him!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man."}
{"text": "But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "And joy comes well in such a needy time:"}
{"text": "What are they, I beseech your ladyship?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;"}
{"text": "One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,"}
{"text": "Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,"}
{"text": "That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Madam, in happy time, what day is that?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,"}
{"text": "The gallant, young and noble gentleman,"}
{"text": "The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,"}
{"text": "Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,"}
{"text": "He shall not make me there a joyful bride."}
{"text": "I wonder at this haste; that I must wed"}
{"text": "Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo."}
{"text": "I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,"}
{"text": "I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,"}
{"text": "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,"}
{"text": "Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,"}
{"text": "And see how he will take it at your hands."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;"}
{"text": "But for the sunset of my brother's son"}
{"text": "It rains downright."}
{"text": "How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?"}
{"text": "Evermore showering? In one little body"}
{"text": "Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;"}
{"text": "For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,"}
{"text": "Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,"}
{"text": "Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;"}
{"text": "Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,"}
{"text": "Without a sudden calm, will overset"}
{"text": "Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!"}
{"text": "Have you deliver'd to her our decree?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks."}
{"text": "I would the fool were married to her grave!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife."}
{"text": "How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?"}
{"text": "Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,"}
{"text": "Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought"}
{"text": "So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:"}
{"text": "Proud can I never be of what I hate;"}
{"text": "But thankful even for hate, that is meant love."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?"}
{"text": "'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'"}
{"text": "And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,"}
{"text": "Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,"}
{"text": "But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,"}
{"text": "To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,"}
{"text": "Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither."}
{"text": "Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!"}
{"text": "You tallow-face!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Fie, fie! what, are you mad?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Good father, I beseech you on my knees,"}
{"text": "Hear me with patience but to speak a word."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!"}
{"text": "I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,"}
{"text": "Or never after look me in the face:"}
{"text": "Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;"}
{"text": "My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest"}
{"text": "That God had lent us but this only child;"}
{"text": "But now I see this one is one too much,"}
{"text": "And that we have a curse in having her:"}
{"text": "Out on her, hilding!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "God in heaven bless her!"}
{"text": "You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,"}
{"text": "Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "I speak no treason."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "O, God ye god-den."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "May not one speak?"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Peace, you mumbling fool!"}
{"text": "Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;"}
{"text": "For here we need it not."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "You are too hot."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "God's bread! it makes me mad:"}
{"text": "Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,"}
{"text": "Alone, in company, still my care hath been"}
{"text": "To have her match'd: and having now provided"}
{"text": "A gentleman of noble parentage,"}
{"text": "Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,"}
{"text": "Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,"}
{"text": "Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;"}
{"text": "And then to have a wretched puling fool,"}
{"text": "A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,"}
{"text": "To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,"}
{"text": "I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'"}
{"text": "But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:"}
{"text": "Graze where you will you shall not house with me:"}
{"text": "Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest."}
{"text": "Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:"}
{"text": "An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;"}
{"text": "And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in"}
{"text": "the streets,"}
{"text": "For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,"}
{"text": "Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:"}
{"text": "Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,"}
{"text": "That sees into the bottom of my grief?"}
{"text": "O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!"}
{"text": "Delay this marriage for a month, a week;"}
{"text": "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed"}
{"text": "In that dim monument where Tybalt lies."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:"}
{"text": "Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?"}
{"text": "My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;"}
{"text": "How shall that faith return again to earth,"}
{"text": "Unless that husband send it me from heaven"}
{"text": "By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me."}
{"text": "Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems"}
{"text": "Upon so soft a subject as myself!"}
{"text": "What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?"}
{"text": "Some comfort, nurse."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Faith, here it is."}
{"text": "Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,"}
{"text": "That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;"}
{"text": "Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth."}
{"text": "Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,"}
{"text": "I think it best you married with the county."}
{"text": "O, he's a lovely gentleman!"}
{"text": "Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,"}
{"text": "Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye"}
{"text": "As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,"}
{"text": "I think you are happy in this second match,"}
{"text": "For it excels your first: or if it did not,"}
{"text": "Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,"}
{"text": "As living here and you no use of him."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Speakest thou from thy heart?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "And from my soul too;"}
{"text": "Or else beshrew them both."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Amen!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "What?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much."}
{"text": "Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,"}
{"text": "Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,"}
{"text": "To make confession and to be absolved."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Marry, I will; and this is wisely done."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!"}
{"text": "Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,"}
{"text": "Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue"}
{"text": "Which she hath praised him with above compare"}
{"text": "So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;"}
{"text": "Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain."}
{"text": "I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:"}
{"text": "If all else fail, myself have power to die."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "On Thursday, sir? the time is very short."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "My father Capulet will have it so;"}
{"text": "And I am nothing slow to slack his haste."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "You say you do not know the lady's mind:"}
{"text": "Uneven is the course, I like it not."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,"}
{"text": "And therefore have I little talk'd of love;"}
{"text": "For Venus smiles not in a house of tears."}
{"text": "Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous"}
{"text": "That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,"}
{"text": "And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,"}
{"text": "To stop the inundation of her tears;"}
{"text": "Which, too much minded by herself alone,"}
{"text": "May be put from her by society:"}
{"text": "Now do you know the reason of this haste."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Happily met, my lady and my wife!"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "That may be, sir, when I may be a wife."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "That may be must be, love, on Thursday next."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "What must be shall be."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "That's a certain text."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Come you to make confession to this father?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "To answer that, I should confess to you."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Do not deny to him that you love me."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I will confess to you that I love him."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "So will ye, I am sure, that you love me."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "If I do so, it will be of more price,"}
{"text": "Being spoke behind your back, than to your face."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "The tears have got small victory by that;"}
{"text": "For it was bad enough before their spite."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;"}
{"text": "And what I spake, I spake it to my face."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "It may be so, for it is not mine own."}
{"text": "Are you at leisure, holy father, now;"}
{"text": "Or shall I come to you at evening mass?"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now."}
{"text": "My lord, we must entreat the time alone."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "God shield I should disturb devotion!"}
{"text": "Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:"}
{"text": "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,"}
{"text": "Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;"}
{"text": "It strains me past the compass of my wits:"}
{"text": "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,"}
{"text": "On Thursday next be married to this county."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,"}
{"text": "Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:"}
{"text": "If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,"}
{"text": "Do thou but call my resolution wise,"}
{"text": "And with this knife I'll help it presently."}
{"text": "God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;"}
{"text": "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,"}
{"text": "Shall be the label to another deed,"}
{"text": "Or my true heart with treacherous revolt"}
{"text": "Turn to another, this shall slay them both:"}
{"text": "Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,"}
{"text": "Give me some present counsel, or, behold,"}
{"text": "'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife"}
{"text": "Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that"}
{"text": "Which the commission of thy years and art"}
{"text": "Could to no issue of true honour bring."}
{"text": "Be not so long to speak; I long to die,"}
{"text": "If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,"}
{"text": "Which craves as desperate an execution."}
{"text": "As that is desperate which we would prevent."}
{"text": "If, rather than to marry County Paris,"}
{"text": "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,"}
{"text": "Then is it likely thou wilt undertake"}
{"text": "A thing like death to chide away this shame,"}
{"text": "That copest with death himself to scape from it:"}
{"text": "And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,"}
{"text": "From off the battlements of yonder tower;"}
{"text": "Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk"}
{"text": "Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;"}
{"text": "Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,"}
{"text": "O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,"}
{"text": "With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;"}
{"text": "Or bid me go into a new-made grave"}
{"text": "And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;"}
{"text": "Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;"}
{"text": "And I will do it without fear or doubt,"}
{"text": "To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent"}
{"text": "To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:"}
{"text": "To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;"}
{"text": "Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:"}
{"text": "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,"}
{"text": "And this distilled liquor drink thou off;"}
{"text": "When presently through all thy veins shall run"}
{"text": "A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse"}
{"text": "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:"}
{"text": "No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;"}
{"text": "The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade"}
{"text": "To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,"}
{"text": "Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;"}
{"text": "Each part, deprived of supple government,"}
{"text": "Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:"}
{"text": "And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death"}
{"text": "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,"}
{"text": "And then awake as from a pleasant sleep."}
{"text": "Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes"}
{"text": "To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:"}
{"text": "Then, as the manner of our country is,"}
{"text": "In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier"}
{"text": "Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault"}
{"text": "Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie."}
{"text": "In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,"}
{"text": "Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,"}
{"text": "And hither shall he come: and he and I"}
{"text": "Will watch thy waking, and that very night"}
{"text": "Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua."}
{"text": "And this shall free thee from this present shame;"}
{"text": "If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,"}
{"text": "Abate thy valour in the acting it."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!"}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous"}
{"text": "In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed"}
{"text": "To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford."}
{"text": "Farewell, dear father!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "So many guests invite as here are writ."}
{"text": "Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks."}
{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they"}
{"text": "can lick their fingers."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "How canst thou try them so?"}
{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his"}
{"text": "own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his"}
{"text": "fingers goes not with me."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Go, be gone."}
{"text": "We shall be much unfurnished for this time."}
{"text": "What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Ay, forsooth."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Well, he may chance to do some good on her:"}
{"text": "A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "See where she comes from shrift with merry look."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin"}
{"text": "Of disobedient opposition"}
{"text": "To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd"}
{"text": "By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,"}
{"text": "And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!"}
{"text": "Henceforward I am ever ruled by you."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Send for the county; go tell him of this:"}
{"text": "I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;"}
{"text": "And gave him what becomed love I might,"}
{"text": "Not step o'er the bounds of modesty."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:"}
{"text": "This is as't should be. Let me see the county;"}
{"text": "Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither."}
{"text": "Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,"}
{"text": "Our whole city is much bound to him."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,"}
{"text": "To help me sort such needful ornaments"}
{"text": "As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "No, not till Thursday; there is time enough."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow."}
{"text": "LADY  CAPULET:"}
{"text": "We shall be short in our provision:"}
{"text": "'Tis now near night."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Tush, I will stir about,"}
{"text": "And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:"}
{"text": "Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;"}
{"text": "I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;"}
{"text": "I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!"}
{"text": "They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself"}
{"text": "To County Paris, to prepare him up"}
{"text": "Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,"}
{"text": "Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,"}
{"text": "I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,"}
{"text": "For I have need of many orisons"}
{"text": "To move the heavens to smile upon my state,"}
{"text": "Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?"}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries"}
{"text": "As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:"}
{"text": "So please you, let me now be left alone,"}
{"text": "And let the nurse this night sit up with you;"}
{"text": "For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,"}
{"text": "In this so sudden business."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Good night:"}
{"text": "Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need."}
{"text": "JULIET:"}
{"text": "Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again."}
{"text": "I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,"}
{"text": "That almost freezes up the heat of life:"}
{"text": "I'll call them back again to comfort me:"}
{"text": "Nurse! What should she do here?"}
{"text": "My dismal scene I needs must act alone."}
{"text": "Come, vial."}
{"text": "What if this mixture do not work at all?"}
{"text": "Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?"}
{"text": "No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there."}
{"text": "What if it be a poison, which the friar"}
{"text": "Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,"}
{"text": "Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,"}
{"text": "Because he married me before to Romeo?"}
{"text": "I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,"}
{"text": "For he hath still been tried a holy man."}
{"text": "How if, when I am laid into the tomb,"}
{"text": "I wake before the time that Romeo"}
{"text": "Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!"}
{"text": "Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,"}
{"text": "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,"}
{"text": "And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?"}
{"text": "Or, if I live, is it not very like,"}
{"text": "The horrible conceit of death and night,"}
{"text": "Together with the terror of the place,--"}
{"text": "As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,"}
{"text": "Where, for these many hundred years, the bones"}
{"text": "Of all my buried ancestors are packed:"}
{"text": "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,"}
{"text": "Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,"}
{"text": "At some hours in the night spirits resort;--"}
{"text": "Alack, alack, is it not like that I,"}
{"text": "So early waking, what with loathsome smells,"}
{"text": "And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,"}
{"text": "That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--"}
{"text": "O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,"}
{"text": "Environed with all these hideous fears?"}
{"text": "And madly play with my forefather's joints?"}
{"text": "And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?"}
{"text": "And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,"}
{"text": "As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?"}
{"text": "O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost"}
{"text": "Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body"}
{"text": "Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!"}
{"text": "Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "They call for dates and quinces in the pastry."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,"}
{"text": "The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:"}
{"text": "Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:"}
{"text": "Spare not for the cost."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Go, you cot-quean, go,"}
{"text": "Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow"}
{"text": "For this night's watching."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now"}
{"text": "All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick."}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;"}
{"text": "But I will watch you from such watching now."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "A jealous hood, a jealous hood!"}
{"text": "Now, fellow,"}
{"text": "What's there?"}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Make haste, make haste."}
{"text": "Sirrah, fetch drier logs:"}
{"text": "Call Peter, he will show thee where they are."}
{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,"}
{"text": "And never trouble Peter for the matter."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!"}
{"text": "Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:"}
{"text": "The county will be here with music straight,"}
{"text": "For so he said he would: I hear him near."}
{"text": "Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!"}
{"text": "Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;"}
{"text": "I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,"}
{"text": "Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:"}
{"text": "Make haste, I say."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:"}
{"text": "Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!"}
{"text": "Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!"}
{"text": "What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;"}
{"text": "Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,"}
{"text": "The County Paris hath set up his rest,"}
{"text": "That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,"}
{"text": "Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!"}
{"text": "I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!"}
{"text": "Ay, let the county take you in your bed;"}
{"text": "He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?"}
{"text": "What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!"}
{"text": "I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!"}
{"text": "Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!"}
{"text": "O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!"}
{"text": "Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "What noise is here?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O lamentable day!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "What is the matter?"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Look, look! O heavy day!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "O me, O me! My child, my only life,"}
{"text": "Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!"}
{"text": "Help, help! Call help."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:"}
{"text": "Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;"}
{"text": "Life and these lips have long been separated:"}
{"text": "Death lies on her like an untimely frost"}
{"text": "Upon the sweetest flower of all the field."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O lamentable day!"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "O woful time!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,"}
{"text": "Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Come, is the bride ready to go to church?"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Ready to go, but never to return."}
{"text": "O son! the night before thy wedding-day"}
{"text": "Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,"}
{"text": "Flower as she was, deflowered by him."}
{"text": "Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;"}
{"text": "My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,"}
{"text": "And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's."}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Have I thought long to see this morning's face,"}
{"text": "And doth it give me such a sight as this?"}
{"text": "LADY CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"}
{"text": "Most miserable hour that e'er time saw"}
{"text": "In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!"}
{"text": "But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,"}
{"text": "But one thing to rejoice and solace in,"}
{"text": "And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!"}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!"}
{"text": "Most lamentable day, most woful day,"}
{"text": "That ever, ever, I did yet behold!"}
{"text": "O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!"}
{"text": "Never was seen so black a day as this:"}
{"text": "O woful day, O woful day!"}
{"text": "PARIS:"}
{"text": "Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!"}
{"text": "Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,"}
{"text": "By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!"}
{"text": "O love! O life! not life, but love in death!"}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!"}
{"text": "Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now"}
{"text": "To murder, murder our solemnity?"}
{"text": "O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!"}
{"text": "Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;"}
{"text": "And with my child my joys are buried."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not"}
{"text": "In these confusions. Heaven and yourself"}
{"text": "Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,"}
{"text": "And all the better is it for the maid:"}
{"text": "Your part in her you could not keep from death,"}
{"text": "But heaven keeps his part in eternal life."}
{"text": "The most you sought was her promotion;"}
{"text": "For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:"}
{"text": "And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced"}
{"text": "Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?"}
{"text": "O, in this love, you love your child so ill,"}
{"text": "That you run mad, seeing that she is well:"}
{"text": "She's not well married that lives married long;"}
{"text": "But she's best married that dies married young."}
{"text": "Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary"}
{"text": "On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,"}
{"text": "In all her best array bear her to church:"}
{"text": "For though fond nature bids us an lament,"}
{"text": "Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "All things that we ordained festival,"}
{"text": "Turn from their office to black funeral;"}
{"text": "Our instruments to melancholy bells,"}
{"text": "Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,"}
{"text": "Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,"}
{"text": "Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,"}
{"text": "And all things change them to the contrary."}
{"text": "FRIAR LAURENCE:"}
{"text": "Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;"}
{"text": "And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare"}
{"text": "To follow this fair corse unto her grave:"}
{"text": "The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;"}
{"text": "Move them no more by crossing their high will."}
{"text": "First Musician:"}
{"text": "Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone."}
{"text": "Nurse:"}
{"text": "Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;"}
{"text": "For, well you know, this is a pitiful case."}
{"text": "First Musician:"}

{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's"}

{"text": "First Musician:"}
{"text": "Why 'Heart's ease?'"}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My"}

{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?"}
{"text": "Second Musician:"}

{"text": "Third Musician:"}
{"text": "Faith, I know not what to say."}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say"}

{"text": "Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:"}
{"text": "And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,"}

{"text": "Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,"}
{"text": "And do not interrupt me in my course."}
{"text": "Why I descend into this bed of death,"}

{"text": "But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry"}
{"text": "In what I further shall intend to do,"}

{"text": "One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!"}
{"text": "I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;"}

{"text": "Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,"}
{"text": "Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe"}
{"text": "That unsubstantial death is amorous,"}
{"text": "And that the lean abhorred monster keeps"}
{"text": "Thee here in dark to be his paramour?"}
{"text": "For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;"}
{"text": "And never from this palace of dim night"}
{"text": "Depart again: here, here will I remain"}
{"text": "With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here"}
{"text": "Will I set up my everlasting rest,"}
{"text": "And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars"}
{"text": "From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!"}
{"text": "Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you"}

{"text": "Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,"}
{"text": "A sleeping potion; which so took effect"}
{"text": "As I intended, for it wrought on her"}
{"text": "The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,"}
{"text": "That he should hither come as this dire night,"}

{"text": "The noble Paris and true Romeo dead."}
{"text": "She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,"}
{"text": "And bear this work of heaven with patience:"}
{"text": "But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;"}
{"text": "And she, too desperate, would not go with me,"}
{"text": "But, as it seems, did violence on herself."}
{"text": "All this I know; and to the marriage"}
{"text": "Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this"}
{"text": "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life"}
{"text": "Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,"}
{"text": "Unto the rigour of severest law."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "We still have known thee for a holy man."}

{"text": "BALTHASAR:"}
{"text": "I brought my master news of Juliet's death;"}
{"text": "And then in post he came from Mantua"}
{"text": "To this same place, to this same monument."}
{"text": "This letter he early bid me give his father,"}
{"text": "And threatened me with death, going in the vault,"}
{"text": "I departed not and left him there."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "Give me the letter; I will look on it."}
{"text": "Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?"}
{"text": "Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"}
{"text": "PAGE:"}
{"text": "He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;"}
{"text": "And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:"}
{"text": "Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;"}
{"text": "And by and by my master drew on him;"}
{"text": "And then I ran away to call the watch."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "This letter doth make good the friar's words,"}
{"text": "Their course of love, the tidings of her death:"}
{"text": "And here he writes that he did buy a poison"}
{"text": "Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal"}
{"text": "Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."}
{"text": "Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!"}
{"text": "See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"}
{"text": "That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love."}
{"text": "And I for winking at your discords too"}
{"text": "Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "O brother Montague, give me thy hand:"}
{"text": "This is my daughter's jointure, for no more"}
{"text": "Can I demand."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "But I can give thee more:"}
{"text": "For I will raise her statue in pure gold;"}
{"text": "That while Verona by that name is known,"}
{"text": "There shall no figure at such rate be set"}
{"text": "As that of true and faithful Juliet."}
{"text": "CAPULET:"}
{"text": "As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;"}

{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "A glooming peace this morning with it brings;"}
{"text": "The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:"}
{"text": "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;"}
{"text": "Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:"}
{"text": "For never was a story of more woe"}
{"text": "Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "I wonder how the king escaped our hands."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "While we pursued the horsemen of the north,"}
{"text": "He slily stole away and left his men:"}
{"text": "Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,"}
{"text": "Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,"}
{"text": "Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,"}
{"text": "Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,"}
{"text": "Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in"}
{"text": "Were by the swords of common soldiers slain."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,"}

{"text": "I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:"}
{"text": "That this is true, father, behold his blood."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,"}
{"text": "Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Speak thou for me and tell them what I did."}
{"text": "YORK:"}

{"text": "But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?"}
{"text": "NORFOLK:"}
{"text": "Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,"}
{"text": "Before I see thee seated in that throne"}
{"text": "Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,"}
{"text": "I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close."}
{"text": "This is the palace of the fearful king,"}
{"text": "And this the regal seat: possess it, York;"}
{"text": "For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;"}
{"text": "For hither we have broken in by force."}
{"text": "NORFOLK:"}
{"text": "We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;"}
{"text": "And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And when the king comes, offer no violence,"}
{"text": "Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "The queen this day here holds her parliament,"}

{"text": "By words or blows here let us win our right."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,"}
{"text": "Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,"}
{"text": "And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice"}
{"text": "Hath made us by-words to our enemies."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;"}
{"text": "I mean to take possession of my right."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,"}
{"text": "The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,"}
{"text": "Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells."}
{"text": "I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:"}
{"text": "Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,"}
{"text": "Even in the chair of state: belike he means,"}
{"text": "Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,"}
{"text": "To aspire unto the crown and reign as king."}
{"text": "Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father."}
{"text": "And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge"}
{"text": "On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!"}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel."}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:"}
{"text": "My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Patience is for poltroons, such as he:"}
{"text": "He durst not sit there, had your father lived."}
{"text": "My gracious lord, here in the parliament"}
{"text": "Let us assail the family of York."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Ah, know you not the city favours them,"}
{"text": "And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?"}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,"}
{"text": "To make a shambles of the parliament-house!"}
{"text": "Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats"}
{"text": "Shall be the war that Henry means to use."}
{"text": "Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,"}
{"text": "and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;"}
{"text": "I am thy sovereign."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "I am thine."}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was."}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "Thy father was a traitor to the crown."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown"}
{"text": "In following this usurping Henry."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Whom should he follow but his natural king?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "It must and shall be so: content thyself."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king."}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;"}
{"text": "And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget"}
{"text": "That we are those which chased you from the field"}
{"text": "And slew your fathers, and with colours spread"}
{"text": "March'd through the city to the palace gates."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;"}
{"text": "And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it."}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,"}
{"text": "Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives"}
{"text": "Than drops of blood were in my father's veins."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,"}
{"text": "I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger"}
{"text": "As shall revenge his death before I stir."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Will you we show our title to the crown?"}
{"text": "If not, our swords shall plead it in the field."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?"}
{"text": "Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;"}
{"text": "Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:"}
{"text": "I am the son of Henry the Fifth,"}
{"text": "Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop"}
{"text": "And seized upon their towns and provinces."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "The lord protector lost it, and not I:"}
{"text": "When I was crown'd I was but nine months old."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose."}
{"text": "Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Sweet father, do so; set it on your head."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,"}
{"text": "Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Sons, peace!"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;"}
{"text": "And be you silent and attentive too,"}
{"text": "For he that interrupts him shall not live."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,"}
{"text": "Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?"}
{"text": "No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;"}
{"text": "Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,"}
{"text": "And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,"}
{"text": "Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?"}
{"text": "My title's good, and better far than his."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "'Twas by rebellion against his king."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "What then?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "An if he may, then am I lawful king;"}
{"text": "For Richard, in the view of many lords,"}
{"text": "Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,"}
{"text": "Whose heir my father was, and I am his."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "He rose against him, being his sovereign,"}
{"text": "And made him to resign his crown perforce."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,"}
{"text": "Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?"}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "No; for he could not so resign his crown"}
{"text": "But that the next heir should succeed and reign."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?"}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "His is the right, and therefore pardon me."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?"}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "My conscience tells me he is lawful king."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,"}
{"text": "Think not that Henry shall be so deposed."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Deposed he shall be, in despite of all."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,"}
{"text": "Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,"}
{"text": "Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,"}
{"text": "Can set the duke up in despite of me."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,"}
{"text": "Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:"}
{"text": "May that ground gape and swallow me alive,"}
{"text": "Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown."}
{"text": "What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Do right unto this princely Duke of York,"}
{"text": "Or I will fill the house with armed men,"}
{"text": "And over the chair of state, where now he sits,"}
{"text": "Write up his title with usurping blood."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:"}
{"text": "Let me for this my life-time reign as king."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,"}
{"text": "And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "I am content: Richard Plantagenet,"}
{"text": "Enjoy the kingdom after my decease."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "What wrong is this unto the prince your son!"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "What good is this to England and himself!"}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "Base, fearful and despairing Henry!"}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "How hast thou injured both thyself and us!"}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "I cannot stay to hear these articles."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Nor I."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news."}
{"text": "WESTMORELAND:"}
{"text": "Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,"}
{"text": "In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Be thou a prey unto the house of York,"}
{"text": "And die in bands for this unmanly deed!"}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,"}
{"text": "Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not."}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "They seek revenge and therefore will not yield."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Ah, Exeter!"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Why should you sigh, my lord?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,"}
{"text": "Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit."}
{"text": "But be it as it may: I here entail"}
{"text": "The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;"}
{"text": "Conditionally, that here thou take an oath"}
{"text": "To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,"}
{"text": "To honour me as thy king and sovereign,"}
{"text": "And neither by treason nor hostility"}
{"text": "To seek to put me down and reign thyself."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "This oath I willingly take and will perform."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "And long live thou and these thy forward sons!"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Now York and Lancaster are reconciled."}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!"}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And I'll keep London with my soldiers."}
{"text": "NORFOLK:"}
{"text": "And I to Norfolk with my followers."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "And I unto the sea from whence I came."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court."}
{"text": "EXETER:"}
{"text": "Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:"}
{"text": "I'll steal away."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Exeter, so will I."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Who can be patient in such extremes?"}
{"text": "Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid"}
{"text": "And never seen thee, never borne thee son,"}
{"text": "Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father"}
{"text": "Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?"}
{"text": "Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,"}
{"text": "Or felt that pain which I did for him once,"}
{"text": "Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,"}
{"text": "Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,"}
{"text": "Rather than have that savage duke thine heir"}
{"text": "And disinherited thine only son."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Father, you cannot disinherit me:"}
{"text": "If you be king, why should not I succeed?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:"}
{"text": "The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?"}
{"text": "I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!"}
{"text": "Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;"}
{"text": "And given unto the house of York such head"}
{"text": "As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance."}
{"text": "To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,"}
{"text": "What is it, but to make thy sepulchre"}
{"text": "And creep into it far before thy time?"}
{"text": "Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;"}
{"text": "Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;"}
{"text": "The duke is made protector of the realm;"}
{"text": "And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds"}
{"text": "The trembling lamb environed with wolves."}
{"text": "Had I been there, which am a silly woman,"}
{"text": "The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes"}
{"text": "Before I would have granted to that act."}
{"text": "But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:"}
{"text": "And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself"}
{"text": "Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,"}
{"text": "Until that act of parliament be repeal'd"}
{"text": "Whereby my son is disinherited."}
{"text": "The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours"}
{"text": "Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;"}
{"text": "And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace"}
{"text": "And utter ruin of the house of York."}
{"text": "Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;"}
{"text": "Our army is ready; come, we'll after them."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "When I return with victory from the field"}
{"text": "I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Come, son, away; we may not linger thus."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Poor queen! how love to me and to her son"}
{"text": "Hath made her break out into terms of rage!"}
{"text": "Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,"}
{"text": "Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,"}
{"text": "Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle"}
{"text": "Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!"}
{"text": "The loss of those three lords torments my heart:"}
{"text": "I'll write unto them and entreat them fair."}

{"text": "Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "No, I can better play the orator."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "But I have reasons strong and forcible."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?"}
{"text": "What is your quarrel? how began it first?"}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "No quarrel, but a slight contention."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "About what?"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "About that which concerns your grace and us;"}
{"text": "The crown of England, father, which is yours."}
{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Your right depends not on his life or death."}

{"text": "Thou canst not, son; it is impossible."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "An oath is of no moment, being not took"}
{"text": "Before a true and lawful magistrate,"}
{"text": "That hath authority over him that swears:"}
{"text": "Henry had none, but did usurp the place;"}
{"text": "Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,"}
{"text": "Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous."}
{"text": "Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think"}
{"text": "How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;"}
{"text": "Within whose circuit is Elysium"}
{"text": "And all that poets feign of bliss and joy."}
{"text": "Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest"}

{"text": "YORK:"}

{"text": "YORK:"}
{"text": "She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,"}

{"text": "But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,"}
{"text": "Made impudent with use of evil deeds,"}
{"text": "I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush."}
{"text": "To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,"}
{"text": "Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless."}
{"text": "Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,"}

{"text": "Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?"}

{"text": "Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:"}

{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?"}
{"text": "Think but upon the wrong he did us all,"}

{"text": "How fares my brother? why is he so sad?"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "I cannot joy, until I be resolved"}
{"text": "Where our right valiant father is become."}
{"text": "I saw him in the battle range about;"}
{"text": "And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth."}
{"text": "Methought he bore him in the thickest troop"}
{"text": "As doth a lion in a herd of neat;"}
{"text": "Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,"}
{"text": "Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,"}
{"text": "The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him."}
{"text": "So fared our father with his enemies;"}

{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;"}
{"text": "Not separated with the racking clouds,"}
{"text": "But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky."}
{"text": "See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,"}

{"text": "Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:"}
{"text": "And after many scorns, many foul taunts,"}

{"text": "For selfsame wind that I should speak withal"}
{"text": "Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,"}

{"text": "To weep is to make less the depth of grief:"}
{"text": "Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me"}

{"text": "Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,"}
{"text": "Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,"}
{"text": "Were brought me of your loss and his depart."}
{"text": "I, then in London keeper of the king,"}
{"text": "Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,"}
{"text": "And very well appointed, as I thought,"}
{"text": "March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,"}
{"text": "Bearing the king in my behalf along;"}
{"text": "For by my scouts I was advertised"}

{"text": "To dash our late decree in parliament"}
{"text": "Touching King Henry's oath and your succession."}
{"text": "Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met"}
{"text": "Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:"}
{"text": "But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,"}
{"text": "Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,"}
{"text": "That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;"}
{"text": "Or whether 'twas report of her success;"}
{"text": "Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,"}
{"text": "Who thunders to his captives blood and death,"}
{"text": "I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,"}
{"text": "Their weapons like to lightning came and went;"}
{"text": "Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,"}
{"text": "Or like an idle thresher with a flail,"}
{"text": "Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends."}
{"text": "I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,"}
{"text": "With promise of high pay and great rewards:"}
{"text": "But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,"}
{"text": "And we in them no hope to win the day;"}
{"text": "So that we fled; the king unto the queen;"}
{"text": "Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,"}
{"text": "In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:"}
{"text": "For in the marches here we heard you were,"}
{"text": "Making another head to fight again."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?"}
{"text": "And when came George from Burgundy to England?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;"}

{"text": "Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;"}
{"text": "For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine"}
{"text": "Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,"}
{"text": "And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,"}
{"text": "Were he as famous and as bold in war"}
{"text": "As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:"}
{"text": "'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak."}
{"text": "But in this troublous time what's to be done?"}
{"text": "Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,"}
{"text": "And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,"}
{"text": "Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?"}
{"text": "Or shall we on the helmets of our foes"}
{"text": "Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?"}
{"text": "If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;"}
{"text": "And therefore comes my brother Montague."}
{"text": "Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,"}
{"text": "With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,"}
{"text": "And of their feather many more proud birds,"}
{"text": "Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax."}
{"text": "He swore consent to your succession,"}
{"text": "His oath enrolled in the parliament;"}
{"text": "And now to London all the crew are gone,"}
{"text": "To frustrate both his oath and what beside"}
{"text": "May make against the house of Lancaster."}
{"text": "Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:"}
{"text": "Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,"}
{"text": "With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,"}
{"text": "Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,"}
{"text": "Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,"}
{"text": "Why, Via! to London will we march amain,"}
{"text": "And once again bestride our foaming steeds,"}
{"text": "And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'"}
{"text": "But never once again turn back and fly."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:"}
{"text": "Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,"}
{"text": "That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;"}
{"text": "And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--"}
{"text": "Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:"}
{"text": "The next degree is England's royal throne;"}
{"text": "For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd"}
{"text": "In every borough as we pass along;"}
{"text": "And he that throws not up his cap for joy"}
{"text": "Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head."}
{"text": "King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,"}
{"text": "Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,"}
{"text": "But sound the trumpets, and about our task."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,"}
{"text": "As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,"}
{"text": "I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "How now! what news?"}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,"}
{"text": "The queen is coming with a puissant host;"}
{"text": "And craves your company for speedy counsel."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York."}
{"text": "Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy"}
{"text": "That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:"}
{"text": "Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:"}
{"text": "To see this sight, it irks my very soul."}
{"text": "Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,"}
{"text": "Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "My gracious liege, this too much lenity"}
{"text": "And harmful pity must be laid aside."}
{"text": "To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?"}
{"text": "Not to the beast that would usurp their den."}
{"text": "Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?"}
{"text": "Not his that spoils her young before her face."}
{"text": "Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?"}
{"text": "Not he that sets his foot upon her back."}
{"text": "The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,"}
{"text": "And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood."}
{"text": "Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,"}
{"text": "Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:"}
{"text": "He, but a duke, would have his son a king,"}
{"text": "And raise his issue, like a loving sire;"}
{"text": "Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,"}
{"text": "Didst yield consent to disinherit him,"}
{"text": "Which argued thee a most unloving father."}
{"text": "Unreasonable creatures feed their young;"}
{"text": "And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,"}
{"text": "Yet, in protection of their tender ones,"}
{"text": "Who hath not seen them, even with those wings"}
{"text": "Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,"}
{"text": "Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,"}
{"text": "Offer their own lives in their young's defence?"}
{"text": "For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!"}
{"text": "Were it not pity that this goodly boy"}
{"text": "Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,"}
{"text": "And long hereafter say unto his child,"}
{"text": "'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got"}
{"text": "My careless father fondly gave away'?"}
{"text": "Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;"}
{"text": "And let his manly face, which promiseth"}
{"text": "Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart"}
{"text": "To hold thine own and leave thine own with him."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,"}
{"text": "Inferring arguments of mighty force."}
{"text": "But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear"}
{"text": "That things ill-got had ever bad success?"}
{"text": "And happy always was it for that son"}
{"text": "Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?"}
{"text": "I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;"}
{"text": "And would my father had left me no more!"}
{"text": "For all the rest is held at such a rate"}
{"text": "As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep"}
{"text": "Than in possession and jot of pleasure."}
{"text": "Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know"}
{"text": "How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,"}
{"text": "And this soft courage makes your followers faint."}
{"text": "You promised knighthood to our forward son:"}
{"text": "Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently."}
{"text": "Edward, kneel down."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;"}
{"text": "And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right."}
{"text": "PRINCE:"}
{"text": "My gracious father, by your kingly leave,"}
{"text": "I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,"}
{"text": "And in that quarrel use it to the death."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Why, that is spoken like a toward prince."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Royal commanders, be in readiness:"}
{"text": "For with a band of thirty thousand men"}
{"text": "Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;"}
{"text": "And in the towns, as they do march along,"}
{"text": "Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:"}
{"text": "Darraign your battle, for they are at hand."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "I would your highness would depart the field:"}
{"text": "The queen hath best success when you are absent."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "Be it with resolution then to fight."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "My royal father, cheer these noble lords"}
{"text": "And hearten those that fight in your defence:"}
{"text": "Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'"}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,"}
{"text": "And set thy diadem upon my head;"}
{"text": "Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!"}
{"text": "Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms"}
{"text": "Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?"}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "I am his king, and he should bow his knee;"}
{"text": "I was adopted heir by his consent:"}
{"text": "Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,"}
{"text": "You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,"}
{"text": "Have caused him, by new act of parliament,"}
{"text": "To blot out me, and put his own son in."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "And reason too:"}
{"text": "Who should succeed the father but the son?"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!"}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,"}
{"text": "Or any he the proudest of thy sort."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?"}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?"}
{"text": "When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,"}
{"text": "Your legs did better service than your hands."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "You said so much before, and yet you fled."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence."}
{"text": "NORTHUMBERLAND:"}
{"text": "No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Northumberland, I hold thee reverently."}
{"text": "Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain"}
{"text": "The execution of my big-swoln heart"}
{"text": "Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,"}
{"text": "As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;"}
{"text": "But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:"}
{"text": "I am a king, and privileged to speak."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here"}
{"text": "Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:"}
{"text": "By him that made us all, I am resolved"}
{"text": "that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?"}
{"text": "A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,"}
{"text": "That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;"}
{"text": "For York in justice puts his armour on."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "If that be right which Warwick says is right,"}
{"text": "There is no wrong, but every thing is right."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;"}
{"text": "For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;"}
{"text": "But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,"}
{"text": "Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,"}
{"text": "As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,"}
{"text": "Whose father bears the title of a king,--"}
{"text": "As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--"}
{"text": "Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,"}
{"text": "To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?"}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,"}
{"text": "To make this shameless callet know herself."}
{"text": "Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,"}
{"text": "Although thy husband may be Menelaus;"}
{"text": "And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd"}
{"text": "By that false woman, as this king by thee."}
{"text": "His father revell'd in the heart of France,"}
{"text": "And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;"}
{"text": "And had he match'd according to his state,"}
{"text": "He might have kept that glory to this day;"}
{"text": "But when he took a beggar to his bed,"}
{"text": "And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,"}
{"text": "Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,"}
{"text": "That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,"}
{"text": "And heap'd sedition on his crown at home."}
{"text": "For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?"}
{"text": "Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;"}
{"text": "And we, in pity of the gentle king,"}
{"text": "Had slipp'd our claim until another age."}
{"text": "GEORGE:"}
{"text": "But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,"}
{"text": "And that thy summer bred us no increase,"}
{"text": "We set the axe to thy usurping root;"}
{"text": "And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,"}
{"text": "Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,"}
{"text": "We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,"}
{"text": "Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "And, in this resolution, I defy thee;"}
{"text": "Not willing any longer conference,"}
{"text": "Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak."}
{"text": "Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!"}
{"text": "And either victory, or else a grave."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Stay, Edward."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:"}
{"text": "These words will cost ten thousand lives this day."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,"}
{"text": "I lay me down a little while to breathe;"}
{"text": "For strokes received, and many blows repaid,"}
{"text": "Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,"}
{"text": "And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!"}
{"text": "For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?"}
{"text": "GEORGE:"}
{"text": "Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;"}
{"text": "Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:"}
{"text": "What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?"}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;"}
{"text": "And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?"}
{"text": "Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,"}
{"text": "Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;"}
{"text": "And in the very pangs of death he cried,"}
{"text": "Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,"}
{"text": "'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'"}
{"text": "So, underneath the belly of their steeds,"}
{"text": "That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,"}
{"text": "The noble gentleman gave up the ghost."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:"}
{"text": "I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly."}
{"text": "Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,"}
{"text": "Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;"}
{"text": "And look upon, as if the tragedy"}
{"text": "Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?"}
{"text": "Here on my knee I vow to God above,"}
{"text": "I'll never pause again, never stand still,"}
{"text": "Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine"}
{"text": "Or fortune given me measure of revenge."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;"}
{"text": "And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!"}
{"text": "And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,"}
{"text": "I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,"}
{"text": "Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,"}
{"text": "Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands"}
{"text": "That to my foes this body must be prey,"}
{"text": "Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,"}
{"text": "And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!"}
{"text": "Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,"}
{"text": "Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth."}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,"}
{"text": "Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:"}
{"text": "I, that did never weep, now melt with woe"}
{"text": "That winter should cut off our spring-time so."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell."}
{"text": "GEORGE:"}
{"text": "Yet let us all together to our troops,"}
{"text": "And give them leave to fly that will not stay;"}
{"text": "And call them pillars that will stand to us;"}
{"text": "And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards"}
{"text": "As victors wear at the Olympian games:"}
{"text": "This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;"}
{"text": "For yet is hope of life and victory."}
{"text": "Forslow no longer, make we hence amain."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:"}
{"text": "Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,"}
{"text": "And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,"}
{"text": "Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall."}
{"text": "CLIFFORD:"}
{"text": "Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:"}
{"text": "This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;"}
{"text": "And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;"}
{"text": "And here's the heart that triumphs in their death"}
{"text": "And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother"}
{"text": "To execute the like upon thyself;"}
{"text": "And so, have at thee!"}
{"text": "RICHARD:"}
{"text": "Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;"}
{"text": "For I myself will hunt this wolf to death."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "This battle fares like to the morning's war,"}
{"text": "When dying clouds contend with growing light,"}
{"text": "What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,"}
{"text": "Can neither call it perfect day nor night."}
{"text": "Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea"}
{"text": "Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;"}
{"text": "Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea"}
{"text": "Forced to retire by fury of the wind:"}
{"text": "Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;"}
{"text": "Now one the better, then another best;"}
{"text": "Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,"}
{"text": "Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:"}
{"text": "So is the equal of this fell war."}
{"text": "Here on this molehill will I sit me down."}
{"text": "To whom God will, there be the victory!"}
{"text": "For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,"}
{"text": "Have chid me from the battle; swearing both"}
{"text": "They prosper best of all when I am thence."}
{"text": "Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;"}
{"text": "For what is in this world but grief and woe?"}
{"text": "O God! methinks it were a happy life,"}
{"text": "To be no better than a homely swain;"}
{"text": "To sit upon a hill, as I do now,"}
{"text": "To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,"}
{"text": "Thereby to see the minutes how they run,"}
{"text": "How many make the hour full complete;"}
{"text": "How many hours bring about the day;"}
{"text": "How many days will finish up the year;"}
{"text": "How many years a mortal man may live."}
{"text": "When this is known, then to divide the times:"}
{"text": "So many hours must I tend my flock;"}
{"text": "So many hours must I take my rest;"}
{"text": "So many hours must I contemplate;"}
{"text": "So many hours must I sport myself;"}
{"text": "So many days my ewes have been with young;"}
{"text": "So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:"}
{"text": "So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:"}
{"text": "So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,"}
{"text": "Pass'd over to the end they were created,"}
{"text": "Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave."}
{"text": "Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!"}
{"text": "Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade"}
{"text": "To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,"}
{"text": "Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy"}
{"text": "To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?"}
{"text": "O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth."}
{"text": "And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,"}
{"text": "His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle."}
{"text": "His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,"}
{"text": "All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,"}
{"text": "Is far beyond a prince's delicates,"}
{"text": "His viands sparkling in a golden cup,"}
{"text": "His body couched in a curious bed,"}
{"text": "When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him."}
{"text": "Son:"}
{"text": "Ill blows the wind that profits nobody."}
{"text": "This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,"}
{"text": "May be possessed with some store of crowns;"}
{"text": "And I, that haply take them from him now,"}
{"text": "May yet ere night yield both my life and them"}
{"text": "To some man else, as this dead man doth me."}
{"text": "Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,"}
{"text": "Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd."}
{"text": "O heavy times, begetting such events!"}
{"text": "From London by the king was I press'd forth;"}
{"text": "My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,"}
{"text": "Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;"}
{"text": "And I, who at his hands received my life, him"}
{"text": "Have by my hands of life bereaved him."}

{"text": "Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!"}
{"text": "Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,"}
{"text": "Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,"}
{"text": "Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,"}
{"text": "Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!"}
{"text": "O, pity, God, this miserable age!"}
{"text": "What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,"}
{"text": "Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,"}
{"text": "This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!"}

{"text": "Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!"}
{"text": "O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!"}
{"text": "O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!"}

{"text": "The fatal colours of our striving houses:"}
{"text": "The one his purple blood right well resembles;"}
{"text": "The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:"}
{"text": "Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;"}

{"text": "These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;"}
{"text": "My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,"}
{"text": "For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;"}
{"text": "My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;"}
{"text": "And so obsequious will thy father be,"}
{"text": "Even for the loss of thee, having no more,"}
{"text": "As Priam was for all his valiant sons."}

{"text": "They never then had sprung like summer flies;"}
{"text": "I and ten thousand in this luckless realm"}
{"text": "Had left no mourning widows for our death;"}
{"text": "And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace."}
{"text": "For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?"}

{"text": "No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:"}

{"text": "I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast."}

{"text": "To effect this marriage, so it please my lord."}
{"text": "EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;"}

{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot."}
{"text": "First Keeper:"}
{"text": "That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow"}
{"text": "Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost."}
{"text": "Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:"}
{"text": "And, for the time shall not seem tedious,"}

{"text": "Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}

{"text": "To greet mine own land with my wishful sight."}
{"text": "No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;"}

{"text": "No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,"}
{"text": "No humble suitors press to speak for right,"}
{"text": "No, not a man comes for redress of thee;"}
{"text": "For how can I help them, and not myself?"}
{"text": "First Keeper:"}
{"text": "Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:"}
{"text": "This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}

{"text": "Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "My queen and son are gone to France for aid;"}
{"text": "And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick"}
{"text": "Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister"}
{"text": "To wife for Edward: if this news be true,"}
{"text": "Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;"}
{"text": "For Warwick is a subtle orator,"}
{"text": "And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words."}
{"text": "By this account then Margaret may win him;"}
{"text": "For she's a woman to be pitied much:"}
{"text": "Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;"}
{"text": "Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;"}
{"text": "The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;"}
{"text": "And Nero will be tainted with remorse,"}
{"text": "To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears."}
{"text": "Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;"}
{"text": "She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,"}
{"text": "He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward."}
{"text": "She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;"}
{"text": "He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;"}
{"text": "That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;"}
{"text": "Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,"}
{"text": "Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,"}
{"text": "And in conclusion wins the king from her,"}
{"text": "With promise of his sister, and what else,"}
{"text": "To strengthen and support King Edward's place."}
{"text": "O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,"}
{"text": "Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!"}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "More than I seem, and less than I was born to:"}
{"text": "A man at least, for less I should not be;"}
{"text": "And men may talk of kings, and why not I?"}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough."}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "My crown is in my heart, not on my head;"}
{"text": "Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,"}
{"text": "Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:"}
{"text": "A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy."}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,"}
{"text": "Your crown content and you must be contented"}
{"text": "To go along with us; for as we think,"}
{"text": "You are the king King Edward hath deposed;"}
{"text": "And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance"}
{"text": "Will apprehend you as his enemy."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "But did you never swear, and break an oath?"}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "No, never such an oath; nor will not now."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Where did you dwell when I was King of England?"}
{"text": "Second Keeper:"}
{"text": "Here in this country, where we now remain."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "I was anointed king at nine months old;"}
{"text": "My father and my grandfather were kings,"}
{"text": "And you were sworn true subjects unto me:"}
{"text": "And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?"}
{"text": "First Keeper:"}
{"text": "No;"}
{"text": "For we were subjects but while you were king."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?"}
{"text": "Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!"}
{"text": "Look, as I blow this feather from my face,"}
{"text": "And as the air blows it to me again,"}
{"text": "Obeying with my wind when I do blow,"}
{"text": "And yielding to another when it blows,"}
{"text": "Commanded always by the greater gust;"}
{"text": "Such is the lightness of you common men."}
{"text": "But do not break your oaths; for of that sin"}
{"text": "My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty."}
{"text": "Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;"}
{"text": "And be you kings, command, and I'll obey."}
{"text": "First Keeper:"}
{"text": "We are true subjects to the king, King Edward."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "So would you be again to Henry,"}
{"text": "If he were seated as King Edward is."}

{"text": "In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:"}

{"text": "I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;"}
{"text": "I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,"}
{"text": "Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,"}
{"text": "And, like a Sinon, take another Troy."}
{"text": "I can add colours to the chameleon,"}
{"text": "Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,"}

{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,"}
{"text": "Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state"}
{"text": "And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "No, mighty King of France: now Margaret"}
{"text": "Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve"}
{"text": "Where kings command. I was, I must confess,"}
{"text": "Great Albion's queen in former golden days:"}
{"text": "But now mischance hath trod my title down,"}
{"text": "And with dishonour laid me on the ground;"}
{"text": "Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,"}
{"text": "And to my humble seat conform myself."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears"}
{"text": "And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,"}
{"text": "And sit thee by our side:"}
{"text": "Yield not thy neck"}
{"text": "To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind"}
{"text": "Still ride in triumph over all mischance."}
{"text": "Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;"}
{"text": "It shall be eased, if France can yield relief."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts"}
{"text": "And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak."}
{"text": "Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,"}
{"text": "That Henry, sole possessor of my love,"}
{"text": "Is of a king become a banish'd man,"}
{"text": "And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;"}
{"text": "While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York"}
{"text": "Usurps the regal title and the seat"}
{"text": "Of England's true-anointed lawful king."}
{"text": "This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,"}
{"text": "With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,"}
{"text": "Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;"}
{"text": "And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:"}
{"text": "Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;"}
{"text": "Our people and our peers are both misled,"}
{"text": "Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,"}
{"text": "And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,"}
{"text": "While we bethink a means to break it off."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow."}
{"text": "And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!"}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;"}
{"text": "For this is he that moves both wind and tide."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "From worthy Edward, King of Albion,"}
{"text": "My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,"}
{"text": "I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,"}
{"text": "First, to do greetings to thy royal person;"}
{"text": "And then to crave a league of amity;"}
{"text": "And lastly, to confirm that amity"}
{"text": "With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant"}
{"text": "That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,"}
{"text": "To England's king in lawful marriage."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,"}
{"text": "Before you answer Warwick. His demand"}
{"text": "Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,"}
{"text": "But from deceit bred by necessity;"}
{"text": "For how can tyrants safely govern home,"}
{"text": "Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?"}
{"text": "To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,"}
{"text": "That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,"}
{"text": "Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son."}
{"text": "Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage"}
{"text": "Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;"}
{"text": "For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,"}
{"text": "Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Injurious Margaret!"}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "And why not queen?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Because thy father Henry did usurp;"}
{"text": "And thou no more are prince than she is queen."}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,"}
{"text": "Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;"}
{"text": "And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,"}
{"text": "Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;"}
{"text": "And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,"}
{"text": "Who by his prowess conquered all France:"}
{"text": "From these our Henry lineally descends."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,"}
{"text": "You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost"}
{"text": "All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?"}
{"text": "Methinks these peers of France should smile at that."}
{"text": "But for the rest, you tell a pedigree"}
{"text": "Of threescore and two years; a silly time"}
{"text": "To make prescription for a kingdom's worth."}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,"}
{"text": "Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,"}
{"text": "And not bewray thy treason with a blush?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,"}
{"text": "Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?"}
{"text": "For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king."}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "Call him my king by whose injurious doom"}
{"text": "My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,"}
{"text": "Was done to death? and more than so, my father,"}
{"text": "Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,"}
{"text": "When nature brought him to the door of death?"}
{"text": "No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,"}
{"text": "This arm upholds the house of Lancaster."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And I the house of York."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,"}
{"text": "Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,"}
{"text": "While I use further conference with Warwick."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!"}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,"}
{"text": "Is Edward your true king? for I were loath"}
{"text": "To link with him that were not lawful chosen."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "But is he gracious in the people's eye?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "The more that Henry was unfortunate."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Then further, all dissembling set aside,"}
{"text": "Tell me for truth the measure of his love"}
{"text": "Unto our sister Bona."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Such it seems"}
{"text": "As may beseem a monarch like himself."}
{"text": "Myself have often heard him say and swear"}
{"text": "That this his love was an eternal plant,"}
{"text": "Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,"}
{"text": "The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,"}
{"text": "Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,"}
{"text": "Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve."}
{"text": "BONA:"}
{"text": "Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:"}
{"text": "Yet I confess that often ere this day,"}
{"text": "When I have heard your king's desert recounted,"}
{"text": "Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;"}
{"text": "And now forthwith shall articles be drawn"}
{"text": "Touching the jointure that your king must make,"}
{"text": "Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised."}
{"text": "Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness"}
{"text": "That Bona shall be wife to the English king."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "To Edward, but not to the English king."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device"}
{"text": "By this alliance to make void my suit:"}
{"text": "Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "And still is friend to him and Margaret:"}
{"text": "But if your title to the crown be weak,"}
{"text": "As may appear by Edward's good success,"}
{"text": "Then 'tis but reason that I be released"}
{"text": "From giving aid which late I promised."}
{"text": "Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand"}
{"text": "That your estate requires and mine can yield."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,"}
{"text": "Where having nothing, nothing can he lose."}
{"text": "And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,"}
{"text": "You have a father able to maintain you;"}
{"text": "And better 'twere you troubled him than France."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,"}
{"text": "Proud setter up and puller down of kings!"}
{"text": "I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,"}
{"text": "Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold"}
{"text": "Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;"}
{"text": "For both of you are birds of selfsame feather."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Warwick, this is some post to us or thee."}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "I like it well that our fair queen and mistress"}
{"text": "Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:"}
{"text": "I hope all's for the best."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "What! has your king married the Lady Grey!"}
{"text": "And now, to soothe your forgery and his,"}
{"text": "Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?"}
{"text": "Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?"}
{"text": "Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "I told your majesty as much before:"}
{"text": "This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,"}
{"text": "And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,"}
{"text": "That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,"}
{"text": "No more my king, for he dishonours me,"}
{"text": "But most himself, if he could see his shame."}
{"text": "Did I forget that by the house of York"}
{"text": "My father came untimely to his death?"}
{"text": "Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?"}
{"text": "Did I impale him with the regal crown?"}
{"text": "Did I put Henry from his native right?"}
{"text": "And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?"}
{"text": "Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:"}
{"text": "And to repair my honour lost for him,"}
{"text": "I here renounce him and return to Henry."}
{"text": "My noble queen, let former grudges pass,"}
{"text": "And henceforth I am thy true servitor:"}
{"text": "I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,"}
{"text": "And replant Henry in his former state."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;"}
{"text": "And I forgive and quite forget old faults,"}
{"text": "And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,"}
{"text": "That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us"}
{"text": "With some few bands of chosen soldiers,"}
{"text": "I'll undertake to land them on our coast"}
{"text": "And force the tyrant from his seat by war."}
{"text": "'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:"}
{"text": "And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,"}
{"text": "He's very likely now to fall from him,"}
{"text": "For matching more for wanton lust than honour,"}
{"text": "Or than for strength and safety of our country."}
{"text": "BONA:"}
{"text": "Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged"}
{"text": "But by thy help to this distressed queen?"}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,"}
{"text": "Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?"}
{"text": "BONA:"}
{"text": "My quarrel and this English queen's are one."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's."}
{"text": "Therefore at last I firmly am resolved"}
{"text": "You shall have aid."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Let me give humble thanks for all at once."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Then, England's messenger, return in post,"}
{"text": "And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"}
{"text": "That Lewis of France is sending over masquers"}
{"text": "To revel it with him and his new bride:"}
{"text": "Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal."}
{"text": "BONA:"}
{"text": "Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"}
{"text": "I'll wear the willow garland for his sake."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,"}
{"text": "And I am ready to put armour on."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"}
{"text": "And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long."}
{"text": "There's thy reward: be gone."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "But, Warwick,"}
{"text": "Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,"}
{"text": "Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;"}
{"text": "And, as occasion serves, this noble queen"}
{"text": "And prince shall follow with a fresh supply."}
{"text": "Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,"}
{"text": "What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "This shall assure my constant loyalty,"}
{"text": "That if our queen and this young prince agree,"}
{"text": "I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy"}
{"text": "To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands."}
{"text": "QUEEN MARGARET:"}
{"text": "Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion."}
{"text": "Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,"}
{"text": "Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;"}
{"text": "And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,"}
{"text": "That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine."}
{"text": "PRINCE EDWARD:"}
{"text": "Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;"}
{"text": "And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand."}
{"text": "KING LEWIS XI:"}
{"text": "Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,"}
{"text": "And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,"}
{"text": "Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet."}
{"text": "I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,"}
{"text": "For mocking marriage with a dame of France."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "I came from Edward as ambassador,"}
{"text": "But I return his sworn and mortal foe:"}
{"text": "Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,"}
{"text": "But dreadful war shall answer his demand."}
{"text": "Had he none else to make a stale but me?"}
{"text": "Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow."}
{"text": "I was the chief that raised him to the crown,"}
{"text": "And I'll be chief to bring him down again:"}
{"text": "Not that I pity Henry's misery,"}
{"text": "But seek revenge on Edward's mockery."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you"}
{"text": "Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?"}
{"text": "Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;"}
{"text": "How could he stay till Warwick made return?"}
{"text": "SOMERSET:"}
{"text": "My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And his well-chosen bride."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "I mind to tell him plainly what I think."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,"}
{"text": "That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,"}
{"text": "Which are so weak of courage and in judgment"}
{"text": "That they'll take no offence at our abuse."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Suppose they take offence without a cause,"}
{"text": "They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,"}
{"text": "Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And shall have your will, because our king:"}
{"text": "Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Not I:"}
{"text": "No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd"}
{"text": "Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity"}
{"text": "To sunder them that yoke so well together."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,"}
{"text": "Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey"}
{"text": "Should not become my wife and England's queen."}
{"text": "And you too, Somerset and Montague,"}
{"text": "Speak freely what you think."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis"}
{"text": "Becomes your enemy, for mocking him"}
{"text": "About the marriage of the Lady Bona."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,"}
{"text": "Is now dishonoured by this new marriage."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased"}
{"text": "By such invention as I can devise?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance"}
{"text": "Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth"}
{"text": "'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Why, knows not Montague that of itself"}
{"text": "England is safe, if true within itself?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "But the safer when 'tis back'd with France."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "'Tis better using France than trusting France:"}
{"text": "Let us be back'd with God and with the seas"}
{"text": "Which He hath given for fence impregnable,"}
{"text": "And with their helps only defend ourselves;"}
{"text": "In them and in ourselves our safety lies."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves"}
{"text": "To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;"}
{"text": "And for this once my will shall stand for law."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,"}
{"text": "To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales"}
{"text": "Unto the brother of your loving bride;"}
{"text": "She better would have fitted me or Clarence:"}
{"text": "But in your bride you bury brotherhood."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir"}
{"text": "Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,"}

{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife"}
{"text": "That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,"}
{"text": "Which being shallow, you give me leave"}

{"text": "Do me but right, and you must all confess"}
{"text": "That I was not ignoble of descent;"}
{"text": "And meaner than myself have had like fortune."}
{"text": "But as this title honours me and mine,"}

{"text": "What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,"}
{"text": "So long as Edward is thy constant friend,"}
{"text": "And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?"}
{"text": "Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,"}
{"text": "Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;"}

{"text": "Now, messenger, what letters or what news"}
{"text": "From France?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,"}

{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,"}
{"text": "Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them."}
{"text": "What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "At my depart, these were his very words:"}
{"text": "'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"}
{"text": "That Lewis of France is sending over masquers"}
{"text": "To revel it with him and his new bride.'"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry."}
{"text": "But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:"}
{"text": "'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"}
{"text": "I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "I blame not her, she could say little less;"}
{"text": "She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?"}
{"text": "For I have heard that she was there in place."}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,"}
{"text": "And I am ready to put armour on.'"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Belike she minds to play the Amazon."}
{"text": "But what said Warwick to these injuries?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "He, more incensed against your majesty"}
{"text": "Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:"}
{"text": "'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"}
{"text": "And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?"}
{"text": "Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:"}
{"text": "They shall have wars and pay for their presumption."}
{"text": "But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in"}

{"text": "I may not prove inferior to yourself."}
{"text": "You that love me and Warwick, follow me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!"}
{"text": "Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;"}
{"text": "And haste is needful in this desperate case."}
{"text": "Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf"}
{"text": "Go levy men, and make prepare for war;"}
{"text": "They are already, or quickly will be landed:"}
{"text": "Myself in person will straight follow you."}
{"text": "But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,"}
{"text": "Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,"}
{"text": "Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:"}
{"text": "Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?"}
{"text": "If it be so, then both depart to him;"}
{"text": "I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:"}
{"text": "But if you mind to hold your true obedience,"}
{"text": "Give me assurance with some friendly vow,"}
{"text": "That I may never have you in suspect."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "So God help Montague as he proves true!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Why, so! then am I sure of victory."}
{"text": "Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,"}
{"text": "Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;"}
{"text": "The common people by numbers swarm to us."}
{"text": "But see where Somerset and Clarence come!"}
{"text": "Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "Fear not that, my lord."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;"}
{"text": "And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice"}
{"text": "To rest mistrustful where a noble heart"}
{"text": "Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;"}
{"text": "Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,"}
{"text": "Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:"}
{"text": "But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine."}
{"text": "And now what rests but, in night's coverture,"}
{"text": "Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,"}
{"text": "His soldiers lurking in the towns about,"}
{"text": "And but attended by a simple guard,"}
{"text": "We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?"}
{"text": "Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:"}
{"text": "That as Ulysses and stout Diomede"}
{"text": "With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,"}
{"text": "And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,"}
{"text": "So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,"}
{"text": "At unawares may beat down Edward's guard"}
{"text": "And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,"}
{"text": "For I intend but only to surprise him."}
{"text": "You that will follow me to this attempt,"}
{"text": "Applaud the name of Henry with your leader."}
{"text": "Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:"}
{"text": "For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!"}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "First Watchman:"}
{"text": "Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:"}
{"text": "The king by this is set him down to sleep."}
{"text": "Second Watchman:"}
{"text": "What, will he not to bed?"}
{"text": "First Watchman:"}
{"text": "Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow"}
{"text": "Never to lie and take his natural rest"}
{"text": "Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd."}
{"text": "Second Watchman:"}
{"text": "To-morrow then belike shall be the day,"}
{"text": "If Warwick be so near as men report."}
{"text": "Third Watchman:"}
{"text": "But say, I pray, what nobleman is that"}
{"text": "That with the king here resteth in his tent?"}
{"text": "First Watchman:"}
{"text": "'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend."}
{"text": "Third Watchman:"}
{"text": "O, is it so? But why commands the king"}
{"text": "That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,"}
{"text": "While he himself keeps in the cold field?"}
{"text": "Second Watchman:"}
{"text": "'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous."}
{"text": "Third Watchman:"}
{"text": "Ay, but give me worship and quietness;"}
{"text": "I like it better than a dangerous honour."}
{"text": "If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,"}
{"text": "'Tis to be doubted he would waken him."}
{"text": "First Watchman:"}
{"text": "Unless our halberds did shut up his passage."}
{"text": "Second Watchman:"}
{"text": "Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,"}
{"text": "But to defend his person from night-foes?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "This is his tent; and see where stand his guard."}
{"text": "Courage, my masters! honour now or never!"}
{"text": "But follow me, and Edward shall be ours."}
{"text": "First Watchman:"}
{"text": "Who goes there?"}
{"text": "Second Watchman:"}
{"text": "Stay, or thou diest!"}
{"text": "SOMERSET:"}
{"text": "What are they that fly there?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,"}
{"text": "Thou call'dst me king."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Ay, but the case is alter'd:"}
{"text": "When you disgraced me in my embassade,"}
{"text": "Then I degraded you from being king,"}
{"text": "And come now to create you Duke of York."}
{"text": "Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,"}
{"text": "That know not how to use ambassadors,"}
{"text": "Nor how to be contented with one wife,"}
{"text": "Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,"}
{"text": "Nor how to study for the people's welfare,"}
{"text": "Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?"}
{"text": "Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down."}
{"text": "Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,"}
{"text": "Of thee thyself and all thy complices,"}
{"text": "Edward will always bear himself as king:"}
{"text": "Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,"}
{"text": "My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:"}
{"text": "But Henry now shall wear the English crown,"}
{"text": "And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow."}
{"text": "My Lord of Somerset, at my request,"}
{"text": "See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd"}
{"text": "Unto my brother, Archbishop of York."}
{"text": "When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,"}
{"text": "I'll follow you, and tell what answer"}
{"text": "Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him."}
{"text": "Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "What fates impose, that men must needs abide;"}
{"text": "It boots not to resist both wind and tide."}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "What now remains, my lords, for us to do"}
{"text": "But march to London with our soldiers?"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;"}
{"text": "To free King Henry from imprisonment"}
{"text": "And see him seated in the regal throne."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn"}
{"text": "What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?"}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "No, but the loss of his own royal person."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "Then is my sovereign slain?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,"}
{"text": "Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard"}
{"text": "Or by his foe surprised at unawares:"}
{"text": "And, as I further have to understand,"}
{"text": "Is new committed to the Bishop of York,"}
{"text": "Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "These news I must confess are full of grief;"}
{"text": "Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:"}
{"text": "Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day."}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay."}
{"text": "And I the rather wean me from despair"}
{"text": "For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:"}
{"text": "This is it that makes me bridle passion"}
{"text": "And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;"}
{"text": "Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear"}
{"text": "And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,"}
{"text": "Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown"}
{"text": "King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown."}
{"text": "RIVERS:"}
{"text": "But, madam, where is Warwick then become?"}
{"text": "QUEEN ELIZABETH:"}
{"text": "I am inform'd that he comes towards London,"}
{"text": "To set the crown once more on Henry's head:"}
{"text": "Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,"}
{"text": "But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--"}
{"text": "For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--"}
{"text": "I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,"}
{"text": "To save at least the heir of Edward's right:"}
{"text": "There shall I rest secure from force and fraud."}
{"text": "Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:"}
{"text": "If Warwick take us we are sure to die."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,"}
{"text": "Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,"}
{"text": "Into this chiefest thicket of the park."}
{"text": "Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,"}
{"text": "Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands"}
{"text": "He hath good usage and great liberty,"}
{"text": "And, often but attended with weak guard,"}
{"text": "Comes hunting this way to disport himself."}
{"text": "I have advertised him by secret means"}
{"text": "That if about this hour he make his way"}
{"text": "Under the colour of his usual game,"}
{"text": "He shall here find his friends with horse and men"}
{"text": "To set him free from his captivity."}
{"text": "Huntsman:"}
{"text": "This way, my lord; for this way lies the game."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand."}
{"text": "Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"}
{"text": "Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Brother, the time and case requireth haste:"}
{"text": "Your horse stands ready at the park-corner."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "But whither shall we then?"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "To Lynn, my lord,"}
{"text": "And ship from thence to Flanders."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?"}
{"text": "Huntsman:"}
{"text": "Better do so than tarry and be hang'd."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;"}
{"text": "And pray that I may repossess the crown."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Master lieutenant, now that God and friends"}
{"text": "Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,"}
{"text": "And turn'd my captive state to liberty,"}
{"text": "My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,"}
{"text": "At our enlargement what are thy due fees?"}
{"text": "Lieutenant:"}
{"text": "Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;"}
{"text": "But if an humble prayer may prevail,"}
{"text": "I then crave pardon of your majesty."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "For what, lieutenant? for well using me?"}
{"text": "Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,"}
{"text": "For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;"}
{"text": "Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds"}
{"text": "Conceive when after many moody thoughts"}
{"text": "At last by notes of household harmony"}
{"text": "They quite forget their loss of liberty."}
{"text": "But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,"}
{"text": "And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;"}
{"text": "He was the author, thou the instrument."}
{"text": "Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite"}
{"text": "By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,"}
{"text": "And that the people of this blessed land"}
{"text": "May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,"}
{"text": "Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,"}
{"text": "I here resign my government to thee,"}
{"text": "For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;"}
{"text": "And now may seem as wise as virtuous,"}
{"text": "By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,"}
{"text": "For few men rightly temper with the stars:"}
{"text": "Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,"}
{"text": "For choosing me when Clarence is in place."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,"}
{"text": "To whom the heavens in thy nativity"}
{"text": "Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,"}
{"text": "As likely to be blest in peace and war;"}
{"text": "And therefore I yield thee my free consent."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "And I choose Clarence only for protector."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:"}
{"text": "Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,"}
{"text": "That no dissension hinder government:"}
{"text": "I make you both protectors of this land,"}
{"text": "While I myself will lead a private life"}
{"text": "And in devotion spend my latter days,"}
{"text": "To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?"}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;"}
{"text": "For on thy fortune I repose myself."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:"}
{"text": "We'll yoke together, like a double shadow"}
{"text": "To Henry's body, and supply his place;"}
{"text": "I mean, in bearing weight of government,"}
{"text": "While he enjoys the honour and his ease."}
{"text": "And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful"}
{"text": "Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,"}
{"text": "And all his lands and goods be confiscate."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "What else? and that succession be determined."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "But, with the first of all your chief affairs,"}
{"text": "Let me entreat, for I command no more,"}
{"text": "That Margaret your queen and my son Edward"}
{"text": "Be sent for, to return from France with speed;"}
{"text": "For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear"}
{"text": "My joy of liberty is half eclipsed."}
{"text": "CLARENCE:"}
{"text": "It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,"}
{"text": "Of whom you seem to have so tender care?"}
{"text": "SOMERSET:"}
{"text": "My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond."}
{"text": "KING HENRY VI:"}
{"text": "Come hither, England's hope."}
{"text": "If secret powers"}
{"text": "Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,"}
{"text": "This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss."}
{"text": "His looks are full of peaceful majesty,"}
{"text": "His head by nature framed to wear a crown,"}
{"text": "His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself"}
{"text": "Likely in time to bless a regal throne."}
{"text": "Make much of him, my lords, for this is he"}
{"text": "Must help you more than you are hurt by me."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "What news, my friend?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "That Edward is escaped from your brother,"}
{"text": "And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?"}
{"text": "Post:"}
{"text": "He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester"}
{"text": "And the Lord Hastings, who attended him"}
{"text": "In secret ambush on the forest side"}
{"text": "And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;"}
{"text": "For hunting was his daily exercise."}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "My brother was too careless of his charge."}
{"text": "But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide"}
{"text": "A salve for any sore that may betide."}
{"text": "SOMERSET:"}
{"text": "My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;"}
{"text": "For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,"}
{"text": "And we shall have more wars before 't be long."}
{"text": "As Henry's late presaging prophecy"}
{"text": "Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,"}
{"text": "So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts"}
{"text": "What may befall him, to his harm and ours:"}
{"text": "Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,"}
{"text": "Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,"}
{"text": "Till storms be past of civil enmity."}
{"text": "OXFORD:"}
{"text": "Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,"}
{"text": "'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down."}
{"text": "SOMERSET:"}
{"text": "It shall be so; he shall to Brittany."}
{"text": "Come, therefore, let's about it speedily."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"}
{"text": "Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,"}
{"text": "And says that once more I shall interchange"}
{"text": "My waned state for Henry's regal crown."}
{"text": "Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas"}
{"text": "And brought desired help from Burgundy:"}
{"text": "What then remains, we being thus arrived"}
{"text": "From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,"}
{"text": "But that we enter, as into our dukedom?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;"}
{"text": "For many men that stumble at the threshold"}
{"text": "Are well foretold that danger lurks within."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:"}
{"text": "By fair or foul means we must enter in,"}
{"text": "For hither will our friends repair to us."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them."}
{"text": "Mayor:"}
{"text": "My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,"}
{"text": "And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;"}
{"text": "For now we owe allegiance unto Henry."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,"}
{"text": "Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York."}
{"text": "Mayor:"}
{"text": "True, my good lord; I know you for no less."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,"}
{"text": "As being well content with that alone."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?"}
{"text": "Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends."}
{"text": "Mayor:"}
{"text": "Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!"}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "The good old man would fain that all were well,"}
{"text": "So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,"}
{"text": "I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade"}
{"text": "Both him and all his brothers unto reason."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut"}
{"text": "But in the night or in the time of war."}
{"text": "What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;"}
{"text": "For Edward will defend the town and thee,"}
{"text": "And all those friends that deign to follow me."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,"}
{"text": "Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?"}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "To help King Edward in his time of storm,"}
{"text": "As every loyal subject ought to do."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget"}
{"text": "Our title to the crown and only claim"}
{"text": "Our dukedom till God please to send the rest."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Then fare you well, for I will hence again:"}
{"text": "I came to serve a king and not a duke."}
{"text": "Drummer, strike up, and let us march away."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate"}
{"text": "By what safe means the crown may be recover'd."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "What talk you of debating? in few words,"}
{"text": "If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,"}
{"text": "I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone"}
{"text": "To keep them back that come to succor you:"}
{"text": "Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?"}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?"}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:"}
{"text": "Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule."}
{"text": "GLOUCESTER:"}
{"text": "And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns."}
{"text": "Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:"}
{"text": "The bruit thereof will bring you many friends."}
{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,"}
{"text": "And Henry but usurps the diadem."}
{"text": "MONTAGUE:"}
{"text": "Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;"}
{"text": "And now will I be Edward's champion."}
{"text": "HASTINGS:"}
{"text": "Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:"}
{"text": "Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation."}
{"text": "Soldier:"}
{"text": "Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of"}

{"text": "KING EDWARD IV:"}
{"text": "Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:"}
{"text": "If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness."}
{"text": "Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;"}
{"text": "And when the morning sun shall raise his car"}
{"text": "Above the border of this horizon,"}
{"text": "We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;"}
{"text": "For well I wot that Henry is no soldier."}
{"text": "Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee"}
{"text": "To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!"}
{"text": "Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick."}
{"text": "Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,"}
{"text": "And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay."}
{"text": "3 KING HENRY VI"}
{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,"}
{"text": "With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,"}
{"text": "Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,"}

{"text": "Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find"}

{"text": "Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,"}

{"text": "WARWICK:"}
{"text": "I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,"}

{"text": "Father of Warwick, know you what this means?"}
{"text": "Look here, I throw my infamy at thee"}
{"text": "I will not ruinate my father's house,"}
{"text": "Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,"}
{"text": "And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,"}
{"text": "That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,"}
{"text": "To bend the fatal instruments of war"}
{"text": "Against his brother and his lawful king?"}
{"text": "Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:"}
{"text": "To keep that oath were more impiety"}
{"text": "Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter."}

{"text": "I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,"}
{"text": "With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--"}

{"text": "Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!"}
{"text": "My parks, my walks, my manors that I had."}
{"text": "Even now forsake me, and of all my lands"}

{"text": "POLIXENES:"}

{"text": "With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere"}
{"text": "With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:"}

{"text": "What was my first? it has an elder sister,"}
{"text": "Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!"}
{"text": "But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?"}
{"text": "Nay, let me have't; I long."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Why, that was when"}
{"text": "Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,"}
{"text": "Ere I could make thee open thy white hand"}
{"text": "And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter"}
{"text": "'I am yours for ever.'"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "'Tis grace indeed."}
{"text": "Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:"}
{"text": "The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;"}

{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I' fecks!"}

{"text": "They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,"}
{"text": "We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:"}

{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,"}

{"text": "Almost as like as eggs; women say so,"}
{"text": "That will say anything but were they false"}
{"text": "As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false"}
{"text": "As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes"}

{"text": "Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:"}
{"text": "Thou dost make possible things not so held,"}
{"text": "Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--"}
{"text": "With what's unreal thou coactive art,"}
{"text": "And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent"}
{"text": "Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,"}
{"text": "And that beyond commission, and I find it,"}
{"text": "And that to the infection of my brains"}
{"text": "And hardening of my brows."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "What means Sicilia?"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "He something seems unsettled."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "How, my lord!"}
{"text": "What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "You look as if you held a brow of much distraction"}
{"text": "Are you moved, my lord?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "No, in good earnest."}
{"text": "How sometimes nature will betray its folly,"}
{"text": "Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime"}
{"text": "To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines"}
{"text": "Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil"}
{"text": "Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,"}
{"text": "In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,"}
{"text": "Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,"}
{"text": "As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:"}
{"text": "How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,"}
{"text": "This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,"}
{"text": "Will you take eggs for money?"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "No, my lord, I'll fight."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,"}
{"text": "Are you so fond of your young prince as we"}
{"text": "Do seem to be of ours?"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "If at home, sir,"}
{"text": "He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,"}
{"text": "Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,"}
{"text": "My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:"}
{"text": "He makes a July's day short as December,"}
{"text": "And with his varying childness cures in me"}
{"text": "Thoughts that would thick my blood."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "So stands this squire"}
{"text": "Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,"}
{"text": "And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,"}
{"text": "How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;"}
{"text": "Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:"}
{"text": "Next to thyself and my young rover, he's"}
{"text": "Apparent to my heart."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "If you would seek us,"}
{"text": "We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,"}
{"text": "Be you beneath the sky."}
{"text": "I am angling now,"}
{"text": "Though you perceive me not how I give line."}
{"text": "Go to, go to!"}
{"text": "How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!"}
{"text": "And arms her with the boldness of a wife"}
{"text": "To her allowing husband!"}
{"text": "Gone already!"}
{"text": "Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and"}

{"text": "Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I"}
{"text": "Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue"}
{"text": "Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour"}
{"text": "Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play."}
{"text": "There have been,"}
{"text": "Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;"}
{"text": "And many a man there is, even at this present,"}
{"text": "Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,"}
{"text": "That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence"}
{"text": "And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by"}
{"text": "Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't"}
{"text": "Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,"}
{"text": "As mine, against their will. Should all despair"}
{"text": "That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind"}
{"text": "Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;"}
{"text": "It is a bawdy planet, that will strike"}
{"text": "Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,"}
{"text": "From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,"}
{"text": "No barricado for a belly; know't;"}
{"text": "It will let in and out the enemy"}
{"text": "With bag and baggage: many thousand on's"}
{"text": "Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "I am like you, they say."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Ay, my good lord."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man."}
{"text": "Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}

{"text": "When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,"}
{"text": "That he did stay?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "At the good queen's entreaty."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent"}
{"text": "But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken"}
{"text": "By any understanding pate but thine?"}
{"text": "For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in"}
{"text": "More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,"}
{"text": "But of the finer natures? by some severals"}
{"text": "Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes"}
{"text": "Perchance are to this business purblind? say."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Business, my lord! I think most understand"}
{"text": "Bohemia stays here longer."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Ha!"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Stays here longer."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Ay, but why?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "To satisfy your highness and the entreaties"}
{"text": "Of our most gracious mistress."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Satisfy!"}
{"text": "The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!"}
{"text": "Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,"}
{"text": "With all the nearest things to my heart, as well"}
{"text": "My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou"}
{"text": "Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed"}
{"text": "Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been"}
{"text": "Deceived in thy integrity, deceived"}
{"text": "In that which seems so."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Be it forbid, my lord!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,"}
{"text": "If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,"}
{"text": "Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining"}
{"text": "From course required; or else thou must be counted"}
{"text": "A servant grafted in my serious trust"}
{"text": "And therein negligent; or else a fool"}
{"text": "That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,"}
{"text": "And takest it all for jest."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "My gracious lord,"}
{"text": "I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;"}
{"text": "In every one of these no man is free,"}
{"text": "But that his negligence, his folly, fear,"}
{"text": "Among the infinite doings of the world,"}
{"text": "Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,"}
{"text": "If ever I were wilful-negligent,"}
{"text": "It was my folly; if industriously"}
{"text": "I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,"}
{"text": "Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful"}
{"text": "To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,"}
{"text": "Where of the execution did cry out"}
{"text": "Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear"}
{"text": "Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,"}
{"text": "Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty"}
{"text": "Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,"}
{"text": "Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass"}
{"text": "By its own visage: if I then deny it,"}
{"text": "'Tis none of mine."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--"}
{"text": "But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass"}
{"text": "Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--"}
{"text": "For to a vision so apparent rumour"}
{"text": "Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation"}
{"text": "Resides not in that man that does not think,--"}
{"text": "My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,"}
{"text": "Or else be impudently negative,"}
{"text": "To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say"}
{"text": "My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name"}
{"text": "As rank as any flax-wench that puts to"}
{"text": "Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I would not be a stander-by to hear"}
{"text": "My sovereign mistress clouded so, without"}
{"text": "My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,"}
{"text": "You never spoke what did become you less"}
{"text": "Than this; which to reiterate were sin"}
{"text": "As deep as that, though true."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Is whispering nothing?"}
{"text": "Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?"}
{"text": "Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career"}
{"text": "Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible"}
{"text": "Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?"}
{"text": "Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?"}
{"text": "Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes"}
{"text": "Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,"}
{"text": "That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?"}
{"text": "Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;"}
{"text": "The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;"}
{"text": "My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,"}
{"text": "If this be nothing."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Good my lord, be cured"}
{"text": "Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;"}
{"text": "For 'tis most dangerous."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Say it be, 'tis true."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "No, no, my lord."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "It is; you lie, you lie:"}
{"text": "I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,"}
{"text": "Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,"}
{"text": "Or else a hovering temporizer, that"}
{"text": "Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,"}
{"text": "Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver"}
{"text": "Infected as her life, she would not live"}
{"text": "The running of one glass."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Who does infect her?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging"}
{"text": "About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I"}
{"text": "Had servants true about me, that bare eyes"}
{"text": "To see alike mine honour as their profits,"}
{"text": "Their own particular thrifts, they would do that"}
{"text": "Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,"}
{"text": "His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form"}
{"text": "Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see"}
{"text": "Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,"}
{"text": "How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,"}
{"text": "To give mine enemy a lasting wink;"}
{"text": "Which draught to me were cordial."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Sir, my lord,"}
{"text": "I could do this, and that with no rash potion,"}
{"text": "But with a lingering dram that should not work"}
{"text": "Maliciously like poison: but I cannot"}
{"text": "Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,"}
{"text": "So sovereignly being honourable."}
{"text": "I have loved thee,--"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Make that thy question, and go rot!"}
{"text": "Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,"}
{"text": "To appoint myself in this vexation, sully"}
{"text": "The purity and whiteness of my sheets,"}
{"text": "Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted"}
{"text": "Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,"}
{"text": "Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,"}
{"text": "Who I do think is mine and love as mine,"}
{"text": "Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?"}
{"text": "Could man so blench?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I must believe you, sir:"}
{"text": "I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;"}
{"text": "Provided that, when he's removed, your highness"}
{"text": "Will take again your queen as yours at first,"}
{"text": "Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing"}
{"text": "The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms"}
{"text": "Known and allied to yours."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Thou dost advise me"}
{"text": "Even so as I mine own course have set down:"}
{"text": "I'll give no blemish to her honour, none."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "My lord,"}
{"text": "Go then; and with a countenance as clear"}
{"text": "As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia"}
{"text": "And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:"}
{"text": "If from me he have wholesome beverage,"}
{"text": "Account me not your servant."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "This is all:"}
{"text": "Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;"}
{"text": "Do't not, thou split'st thine own."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I'll do't, my lord."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "O miserable lady! But, for me,"}
{"text": "What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner"}
{"text": "Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't"}
{"text": "Is the obedience to a master, one"}
{"text": "Who in rebellion with himself will have"}
{"text": "All that are his so too. To do this deed,"}
{"text": "Promotion follows. If I could find example"}
{"text": "Of thousands that had struck anointed kings"}
{"text": "And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since"}
{"text": "Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,"}
{"text": "Let villany itself forswear't. I must"}
{"text": "Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain"}
{"text": "To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!"}
{"text": "Here comes Bohemia."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "This is strange: methinks"}
{"text": "My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?"}
{"text": "Good day, Camillo."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Hail, most royal sir!"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "What is the news i' the court?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "None rare, my lord."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "The king hath on him such a countenance"}
{"text": "As he had lost some province and a region"}
{"text": "Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him"}
{"text": "With customary compliment; when he,"}
{"text": "Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling"}
{"text": "A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and"}
{"text": "So leaves me to consider what is breeding"}
{"text": "That changeth thus his manners."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I dare not know, my lord."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?"}
{"text": "Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;"}
{"text": "For, to yourself, what you do know, you must."}
{"text": "And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,"}
{"text": "Your changed complexions are to me a mirror"}
{"text": "Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be"}
{"text": "A party in this alteration, finding"}
{"text": "Myself thus alter'd with 't."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "There is a sickness"}
{"text": "Which puts some of us in distemper, but"}
{"text": "I cannot name the disease; and it is caught"}
{"text": "Of you that yet are well."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "How! caught of me!"}
{"text": "Make me not sighted like the basilisk:"}
{"text": "I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better"}
{"text": "By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--"}
{"text": "As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto"}
{"text": "Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns"}
{"text": "Our gentry than our parents' noble names,"}
{"text": "In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,"}
{"text": "If you know aught which does behove my knowledge"}
{"text": "Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not"}
{"text": "In ignorant concealment."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I may not answer."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!"}
{"text": "I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,"}
{"text": "I conjure thee, by all the parts of man"}
{"text": "Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least"}
{"text": "Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare"}
{"text": "What incidency thou dost guess of harm"}
{"text": "Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;"}
{"text": "Which way to be prevented, if to be;"}
{"text": "If not, how best to bear it."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Sir, I will tell you;"}
{"text": "Since I am charged in honour and by him"}
{"text": "That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,"}
{"text": "Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as"}
{"text": "I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me"}
{"text": "Cry lost, and so good night!"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "On, good Camillo."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I am appointed him to murder you."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "By whom, Camillo?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "By the king."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "For what?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,"}
{"text": "As he had seen't or been an instrument"}
{"text": "To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen"}
{"text": "Forbiddenly."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "O, then my best blood turn"}
{"text": "To an infected jelly and my name"}
{"text": "Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!"}
{"text": "Turn then my freshest reputation to"}
{"text": "A savour that may strike the dullest nostril"}
{"text": "Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,"}
{"text": "Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection"}
{"text": "That e'er was heard or read!"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Swear his thought over"}
{"text": "By each particular star in heaven and"}
{"text": "By all their influences, you may as well"}
{"text": "Forbid the sea for to obey the moon"}
{"text": "As or by oath remove or counsel shake"}
{"text": "The fabric of his folly, whose foundation"}
{"text": "Is piled upon his faith and will continue"}
{"text": "The standing of his body."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "How should this grow?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to"}
{"text": "Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born."}
{"text": "If therefore you dare trust my honesty,"}
{"text": "That lies enclosed in this trunk which you"}
{"text": "Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!"}
{"text": "Your followers I will whisper to the business,"}
{"text": "And will by twos and threes at several posterns"}
{"text": "Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put"}
{"text": "My fortunes to your service, which are here"}
{"text": "By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;"}
{"text": "For, by the honour of my parents, I"}
{"text": "Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,"}
{"text": "I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer"}
{"text": "Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon"}
{"text": "His execution sworn."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "I do believe thee:"}
{"text": "I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:"}
{"text": "Be pilot to me and thy places shall"}
{"text": "Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and"}
{"text": "My people did expect my hence departure"}
{"text": "Two days ago. This jealousy"}
{"text": "Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,"}
{"text": "Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,"}
{"text": "Must it be violent, and as he does conceive"}
{"text": "He is dishonour'd by a man which ever"}
{"text": "Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must"}
{"text": "In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:"}
{"text": "Good expedition be my friend, and comfort"}
{"text": "The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing"}
{"text": "Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;"}
{"text": "I will respect thee as a father if"}
{"text": "Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "It is in mine authority to command"}
{"text": "The keys of all the posterns: please your highness"}
{"text": "To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,"}
{"text": "'Tis past enduring."}
{"text": "First Lady:"}
{"text": "Come, my gracious lord,"}
{"text": "Shall I be your playfellow?"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "No, I'll none of you."}
{"text": "First Lady:"}
{"text": "Why, my sweet lord?"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if"}
{"text": "I were a baby still. I love you better."}
{"text": "Second Lady:"}
{"text": "And why so, my lord?"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "Not for because"}
{"text": "Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,"}
{"text": "Become some women best, so that there be not"}
{"text": "Too much hair there, but in a semicircle"}
{"text": "Or a half-moon made with a pen."}
{"text": "Second Lady:"}
{"text": "Who taught you this?"}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now"}
{"text": "What colour are your eyebrows?"}
{"text": "First Lady:"}
{"text": "Blue, my lord."}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose"}
{"text": "That has been blue, but not her eyebrows."}
{"text": "First Lady:"}
{"text": "Hark ye;"}
{"text": "The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall"}
{"text": "Present our services to a fine new prince"}
{"text": "One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,"}
{"text": "If we would have you."}
{"text": "Second Lady:"}
{"text": "She is spread of late"}
{"text": "Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now"}
{"text": "I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,"}
{"text": "And tell 's a tale."}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "Merry or sad shall't be?"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "As merry as you will."}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "A sad tale's best for winter: I have one"}
{"text": "Of sprites and goblins."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Let's have that, good sir."}
{"text": "Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best"}
{"text": "To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it."}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "There was a man--"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Nay, come, sit down; then on."}
{"text": "MAMILLIUS:"}
{"text": "Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;"}
{"text": "Yond crickets shall not hear it."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Come on, then,"}
{"text": "And give't me in mine ear."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?"}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never"}
{"text": "Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them"}
{"text": "Even to their ships."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "How blest am I"}
{"text": "In my just censure, in my true opinion!"}
{"text": "Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed"}
{"text": "In being so blest! There may be in the cup"}
{"text": "A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,"}
{"text": "And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge"}
{"text": "Is not infected: but if one present"}
{"text": "The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known"}
{"text": "How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,"}
{"text": "With violent hefts. I have drunk,"}
{"text": "and seen the spider."}
{"text": "Camillo was his help in this, his pander:"}
{"text": "There is a plot against my life, my crown;"}
{"text": "All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain"}
{"text": "Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:"}
{"text": "He has discover'd my design, and I"}
{"text": "Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick"}
{"text": "For them to play at will. How came the posterns"}
{"text": "So easily open?"}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "By his great authority;"}
{"text": "Which often hath no less prevail'd than so"}
{"text": "On your command."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I know't too well."}
{"text": "Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:"}
{"text": "Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you"}
{"text": "Have too much blood in him."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "What is this? sport?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;"}
{"text": "Away with him! and let her sport herself"}
{"text": "With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes"}
{"text": "Has made thee swell thus."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "But I'ld say he had not,"}
{"text": "And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,"}
{"text": "Howe'er you lean to the nayward."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "You, my lords,"}
{"text": "Look on her, mark her well; be but about"}
{"text": "To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and"}
{"text": "The justice of your bearts will thereto add"}
{"text": "'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'"}
{"text": "Praise her but for this her without-door form,"}
{"text": "Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight"}
{"text": "The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands"}
{"text": "That calumny doth use--O, I am out--"}
{"text": "That mercy does, for calumny will sear"}
{"text": "Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,"}
{"text": "When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between"}
{"text": "Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,"}
{"text": "From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,"}
{"text": "She's an adulteress."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Should a villain say so,"}
{"text": "The most replenish'd villain in the world,"}
{"text": "He were as much more villain: you, my lord,"}
{"text": "Do but mistake."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "You have mistook, my lady,"}
{"text": "Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!"}
{"text": "Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,"}
{"text": "Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,"}
{"text": "Should a like language use to all degrees"}
{"text": "And mannerly distinguishment leave out"}
{"text": "Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said"}
{"text": "She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:"}
{"text": "More, she's a traitor and Camillo is"}
{"text": "A federary with her, and one that knows"}
{"text": "What she should shame to know herself"}
{"text": "But with her most vile principal, that she's"}
{"text": "A bed-swerver, even as bad as those"}
{"text": "That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy"}
{"text": "To this their late escape."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "No, by my life."}
{"text": "Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,"}
{"text": "When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that"}
{"text": "You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,"}
{"text": "You scarce can right me throughly then to say"}
{"text": "You did mistake."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "No; if I mistake"}
{"text": "In those foundations which I build upon,"}
{"text": "The centre is not big enough to bear"}
{"text": "A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!"}
{"text": "He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty"}
{"text": "But that he speaks."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "There's some ill planet reigns:"}
{"text": "I must be patient till the heavens look"}
{"text": "With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,"}
{"text": "I am not prone to weeping, as our sex"}
{"text": "Commonly are; the want of which vain dew"}
{"text": "Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have"}
{"text": "That honourable grief lodged here which burns"}
{"text": "Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,"}
{"text": "With thoughts so qualified as your charities"}
{"text": "Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so"}
{"text": "The king's will be perform'd!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Shall I be heard?"}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,"}
{"text": "My women may be with me; for you see"}
{"text": "My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;"}
{"text": "There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress"}
{"text": "Has deserved prison, then abound in tears"}
{"text": "As I come out: this action I now go on"}
{"text": "Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:"}
{"text": "I never wish'd to see you sorry; now"}
{"text": "I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Go, do our bidding; hence!"}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Beseech your highness, call the queen again."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice"}
{"text": "Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,"}
{"text": "Yourself, your queen, your son."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}

{"text": "I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,"}
{"text": "Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless"}
{"text": "I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,"}
{"text": "In this which you accuse her."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "If it prove"}
{"text": "She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where"}
{"text": "I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;"}
{"text": "Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;"}
{"text": "For every inch of woman in the world,"}
{"text": "Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Hold your peaces."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Good my lord,--"}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:"}
{"text": "You are abused and by some putter-on"}
{"text": "That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,"}
{"text": "I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,"}
{"text": "I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven"}
{"text": "The second and the third, nine, and some five;"}
{"text": "If this prove true, they'll pay for't:"}
{"text": "by mine honour,"}
{"text": "I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,"}
{"text": "To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;"}
{"text": "And I had rather glib myself than they"}
{"text": "Should not produce fair issue."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Cease; no more."}
{"text": "You smell this business with a sense as cold"}
{"text": "As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't"}
{"text": "As you feel doing thus; and see withal"}
{"text": "The instruments that feel."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "If it be so,"}
{"text": "We need no grave to bury honesty:"}
{"text": "There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten"}
{"text": "Of the whole dungy earth."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "What! lack I credit?"}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,"}
{"text": "Upon this ground; and more it would content me"}
{"text": "To have her honour true than your suspicion,"}
{"text": "Be blamed for't how you might."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Why, what need we"}
{"text": "Commune with you of this, but rather follow"}
{"text": "Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative"}
{"text": "Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness"}
{"text": "Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied"}
{"text": "Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not"}
{"text": "Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves"}
{"text": "We need no more of your advice: the matter,"}
{"text": "The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all"}
{"text": "Properly ours."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "And I wish, my liege,"}
{"text": "You had only in your silent judgment tried it,"}
{"text": "Without more overture."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "How could that be?"}
{"text": "Either thou art most ignorant by age,"}
{"text": "Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,"}
{"text": "Added to their familiarity,"}
{"text": "Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,"}
{"text": "That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation"}
{"text": "But only seeing, all other circumstances"}
{"text": "Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:"}
{"text": "Yet, for a greater confirmation,"}
{"text": "For in an act of this importance 'twere"}
{"text": "Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post"}
{"text": "To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,"}
{"text": "Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know"}
{"text": "Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle"}
{"text": "They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,"}
{"text": "Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?"}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Well done, my lord."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Though I am satisfied and need no more"}
{"text": "Than what I know, yet shall the oracle"}
{"text": "Give rest to the minds of others, such as he"}
{"text": "Whose ignorant credulity will not"}
{"text": "Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good"}
{"text": "From our free person she should be confined,"}
{"text": "Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence"}
{"text": "Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;"}
{"text": "We are to speak in public; for this business"}
{"text": "Will raise us all."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "The keeper of the prison, call to him;"}
{"text": "let him have knowledge who I am."}
{"text": "Good lady,"}
{"text": "No court in Europe is too good for thee;"}
{"text": "What dost thou then in prison?"}
{"text": "Now, good sir,"}
{"text": "You know me, do you not?"}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "For a worthy lady"}
{"text": "And one whom much I honour."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Pray you then,"}
{"text": "Conduct me to the queen."}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "I may not, madam:"}
{"text": "To the contrary I have express commandment."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Here's ado,"}
{"text": "To lock up honesty and honour from"}
{"text": "The access of gentle visitors!"}
{"text": "Is't lawful, pray you,"}
{"text": "To see her women? any of them? Emilia?"}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "So please you, madam,"}
{"text": "To put apart these your attendants, I"}
{"text": "Shall bring Emilia forth."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I pray now, call her."}
{"text": "Withdraw yourselves."}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "And, madam,"}
{"text": "I must be present at your conference."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Well, be't so, prithee."}
{"text": "Here's such ado to make no stain a stain"}
{"text": "As passes colouring."}
{"text": "Dear gentlewoman,"}
{"text": "How fares our gracious lady?"}
{"text": "EMILIA:"}
{"text": "As well as one so great and so forlorn"}
{"text": "May hold together: on her frights and griefs,"}
{"text": "Which never tender lady hath born greater,"}
{"text": "She is something before her time deliver'd."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "A boy?"}
{"text": "EMILIA:"}
{"text": "A daughter, and a goodly babe,"}
{"text": "Lusty and like to live: the queen receives"}
{"text": "Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,"}
{"text": "I am innocent as you.'"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I dare be sworn"}
{"text": "These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,"}
{"text": "beshrew them!"}
{"text": "He must be told on't, and he shall: the office"}
{"text": "Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:"}
{"text": "If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister"}
{"text": "And never to my red-look'd anger be"}
{"text": "The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,"}
{"text": "Commend my best obedience to the queen:"}
{"text": "If she dares trust me with her little babe,"}
{"text": "I'll show't the king and undertake to be"}
{"text": "Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know"}
{"text": "How he may soften at the sight o' the child:"}
{"text": "The silence often of pure innocence"}
{"text": "Persuades when speaking fails."}
{"text": "EMILIA:"}
{"text": "Most worthy madam,"}
{"text": "Your honour and your goodness is so evident"}
{"text": "That your free undertaking cannot miss"}
{"text": "A thriving issue: there is no lady living"}
{"text": "So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship"}
{"text": "To visit the next room, I'll presently"}
{"text": "Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;"}
{"text": "Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,"}
{"text": "But durst not tempt a minister of honour,"}
{"text": "Lest she should be denied."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Tell her, Emilia."}
{"text": "I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't"}
{"text": "As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted"}
{"text": "I shall do good."}
{"text": "EMILIA:"}
{"text": "Now be you blest for it!"}
{"text": "I'll to the queen: please you,"}
{"text": "come something nearer."}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,"}
{"text": "I know not what I shall incur to pass it,"}
{"text": "Having no warrant."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "You need not fear it, sir:"}
{"text": "This child was prisoner to the womb and is"}
{"text": "By law and process of great nature thence"}
{"text": "Freed and enfranchised, not a party to"}
{"text": "The anger of the king nor guilty of,"}
{"text": "If any be, the trespass of the queen."}
{"text": "Gaoler:"}
{"text": "I do believe it."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Do not you fear: upon mine honour,"}
{"text": "I will stand betwixt you and danger."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness"}
{"text": "To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If"}
{"text": "The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,"}
{"text": "She the adulteress; for the harlot king"}
{"text": "Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank"}
{"text": "And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she"}
{"text": "I can hook to me: say that she were gone,"}
{"text": "Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest"}
{"text": "Might come to me again. Who's there?"}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "My lord?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "How does the boy?"}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "He took good rest to-night;"}
{"text": "'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "To see his nobleness!"}
{"text": "Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,"}
{"text": "He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,"}
{"text": "Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,"}
{"text": "Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,"}
{"text": "And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,"}
{"text": "See how he fares."}
{"text": "Fie, fie! no thought of him:"}
{"text": "The thought of my revenges that way"}
{"text": "Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,"}
{"text": "And in his parties, his alliance; let him be"}
{"text": "Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,"}
{"text": "Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes"}
{"text": "Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:"}
{"text": "They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor"}
{"text": "Shall she within my power."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "You must not enter."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:"}
{"text": "Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,"}
{"text": "Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,"}
{"text": "More free than he is jealous."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "That's enough."}
{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded"}
{"text": "None should come at him."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Not so hot, good sir:"}
{"text": "I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,"}
{"text": "That creep like shadows by him and do sigh"}
{"text": "At each his needless heavings, such as you"}
{"text": "Nourish the cause of his awaking: I"}
{"text": "Do come with words as medicinal as true,"}
{"text": "Honest as either, to purge him of that humour"}
{"text": "That presses him from sleep."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "What noise there, ho?"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "No noise, my lord; but needful conference"}
{"text": "About some gossips for your highness."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "How!"}
{"text": "Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,"}
{"text": "I charged thee that she should not come about me:"}
{"text": "I knew she would."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "I told her so, my lord,"}
{"text": "On your displeasure's peril and on mine,"}
{"text": "She should not visit you."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "What, canst not rule her?"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "From all dishonesty he can: in this,"}
{"text": "Unless he take the course that you have done,"}
{"text": "Commit me for committing honour, trust it,"}
{"text": "He shall not rule me."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "La you now, you hear:"}
{"text": "When she will take the rein I let her run;"}
{"text": "But she'll not stumble."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Good my liege, I come;"}
{"text": "And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess"}
{"text": "Myself your loyal servant, your physician,"}
{"text": "Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare"}
{"text": "Less appear so in comforting your evils,"}
{"text": "Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come"}
{"text": "From your good queen."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Good queen!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Good queen, my lord,"}
{"text": "Good queen; I say good queen;"}
{"text": "And would by combat make her good, so were I"}
{"text": "A man, the worst about you."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Force her hence."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes"}
{"text": "First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;"}
{"text": "But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,"}
{"text": "For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;"}
{"text": "Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Out!"}
{"text": "A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:"}
{"text": "A most intelligencing bawd!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Not so:"}
{"text": "I am as ignorant in that as you"}
{"text": "In so entitling me, and no less honest"}
{"text": "Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,"}
{"text": "As this world goes, to pass for honest."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Traitors!"}
{"text": "Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard."}
{"text": "Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted"}
{"text": "By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;"}
{"text": "Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "For ever"}
{"text": "Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou"}
{"text": "Takest up the princess by that forced baseness"}
{"text": "Which he has put upon't!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "He dreads his wife."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt"}
{"text": "You'ld call your children yours."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "A nest of traitors!"}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "I am none, by this good light."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Nor I, nor any"}
{"text": "But one that's here, and that's himself, for he"}
{"text": "The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,"}
{"text": "His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,"}
{"text": "Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;"}
{"text": "and will not--"}
{"text": "For, as the case now stands, it is a curse"}
{"text": "He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove"}
{"text": "The root of his opinion, which is rotten"}
{"text": "As ever oak or stone was sound."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "A callat"}
{"text": "Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband"}
{"text": "And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;"}
{"text": "It is the issue of Polixenes:"}
{"text": "Hence with it, and together with the dam"}
{"text": "Commit them to the fire!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "It is yours;"}
{"text": "And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,"}
{"text": "So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,"}
{"text": "Although the print be little, the whole matter"}
{"text": "And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,"}
{"text": "The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,"}
{"text": "The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,"}
{"text": "His smiles,"}
{"text": "The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:"}
{"text": "And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it"}
{"text": "So like to him that got it, if thou hast"}
{"text": "The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours"}
{"text": "No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,"}
{"text": "Her children not her husband's!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "A gross hag"}
{"text": "And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,"}
{"text": "That wilt not stay her tongue."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Hang all the husbands"}
{"text": "That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself"}
{"text": "Hardly one subject."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Once more, take her hence."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "A most unworthy and unnatural lord"}
{"text": "Can do no more."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I'll ha' thee burnt."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I care not:"}
{"text": "It is an heretic that makes the fire,"}
{"text": "Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;"}
{"text": "But this most cruel usage of your queen,"}
{"text": "Not able to produce more accusation"}
{"text": "Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours"}
{"text": "Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,"}
{"text": "Yea, scandalous to the world."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "On your allegiance,"}
{"text": "Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,"}
{"text": "Where were her life? she durst not call me so,"}
{"text": "If she did know me one. Away with her!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone."}
{"text": "Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:"}
{"text": "Jove send her"}
{"text": "A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?"}
{"text": "You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,"}
{"text": "Will never do him good, not one of you."}
{"text": "So, so: farewell; we are gone."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this."}
{"text": "My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast"}
{"text": "A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence"}
{"text": "And see it instantly consumed with fire;"}
{"text": "Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:"}
{"text": "Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,"}
{"text": "And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,"}
{"text": "With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse"}
{"text": "And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;"}
{"text": "The bastard brains with these my proper hands"}
{"text": "Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;"}
{"text": "For thou set'st on thy wife."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "I did not, sir:"}
{"text": "These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,"}
{"text": "Can clear me in't."}
{"text": "Lords:"}
{"text": "We can: my royal liege,"}
{"text": "He is not guilty of her coming hither."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "You're liars all."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "Beseech your highness, give us better credit:"}
{"text": "We have always truly served you, and beseech you"}
{"text": "So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,"}
{"text": "As recompense of our dear services"}
{"text": "Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,"}
{"text": "Which being so horrible, so bloody, must"}
{"text": "Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I am a feather for each wind that blows:"}
{"text": "Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel"}
{"text": "And call me father? better burn it now"}
{"text": "Than curse it then. But be it; let it live."}
{"text": "It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;"}
{"text": "You that have been so tenderly officious"}
{"text": "With Lady Margery, your midwife there,"}
{"text": "To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,"}
{"text": "So sure as this beard's grey,"}
{"text": "--what will you adventure"}
{"text": "To save this brat's life?"}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Any thing, my lord,"}
{"text": "That my ability may undergo"}
{"text": "And nobleness impose: at least thus much:"}
{"text": "I'll pawn the little blood which I have left"}
{"text": "To save the innocent: any thing possible."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "It shall be possible. Swear by this sword"}
{"text": "Thou wilt perform my bidding."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "I will, my lord."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail"}
{"text": "Of any point in't shall not only be"}
{"text": "Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,"}
{"text": "Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,"}
{"text": "As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry"}
{"text": "This female bastard hence and that thou bear it"}
{"text": "To some remote and desert place quite out"}
{"text": "Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,"}
{"text": "Without more mercy, to its own protection"}
{"text": "And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune"}
{"text": "It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,"}
{"text": "On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,"}
{"text": "That thou commend it strangely to some place"}
{"text": "Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "I swear to do this, though a present death"}
{"text": "Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:"}
{"text": "Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens"}
{"text": "To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say"}
{"text": "Casting their savageness aside have done"}
{"text": "Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous"}
{"text": "In more than this deed does require! And blessing"}
{"text": "Against this cruelty fight on thy side,"}
{"text": "Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "No, I'll not rear"}
{"text": "Another's issue."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "Please your highness, posts"}
{"text": "From those you sent to the oracle are come"}
{"text": "An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,"}
{"text": "Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,"}
{"text": "Hasting to the court."}
{"text": "First Lord:"}
{"text": "So please you, sir, their speed"}
{"text": "Hath been beyond account."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Twenty-three days"}
{"text": "They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells"}
{"text": "The great Apollo suddenly will have"}
{"text": "The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;"}
{"text": "Summon a session, that we may arraign"}
{"text": "Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath"}
{"text": "Been publicly accused, so shall she have"}
{"text": "A just and open trial. While she lives"}
{"text": "My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,"}
{"text": "And think upon my bidding."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,"}
{"text": "Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing"}
{"text": "The common praise it bears."}
{"text": "DION:"}
{"text": "I shall report,"}
{"text": "For most it caught me, the celestial habits,"}
{"text": "Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence"}
{"text": "Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!"}
{"text": "How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly"}
{"text": "It was i' the offering!"}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "But of all, the burst"}
{"text": "And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,"}
{"text": "Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense."}
{"text": "That I was nothing."}
{"text": "DION:"}
{"text": "If the event o' the journey"}
{"text": "Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--"}
{"text": "As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,"}
{"text": "The time is worth the use on't."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "Great Apollo"}
{"text": "Turn all to the best! These proclamations,"}
{"text": "So forcing faults upon Hermione,"}
{"text": "I little like."}
{"text": "DION:"}
{"text": "The violent carriage of it"}
{"text": "Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,"}
{"text": "Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,"}
{"text": "Shall the contents discover, something rare"}
{"text": "Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!"}
{"text": "And gracious be the issue!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,"}
{"text": "Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried"}
{"text": "The daughter of a king, our wife, and one"}
{"text": "Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd"}
{"text": "Of being tyrannous, since we so openly"}
{"text": "Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,"}
{"text": "Even to the guilt or the purgation."}
{"text": "Produce the prisoner."}

{"text": "Since what I am to say must be but that"}

{"text": "But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me"}
{"text": "To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity"}
{"text": "Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,"}
{"text": "Be so received. But thus: if powers divine"}
{"text": "Behold our human actions, as they do,"}
{"text": "I doubt not then but innocence shall make"}
{"text": "False accusation blush and tyranny"}
{"text": "Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,"}
{"text": "Who least will seem to do so, my past life"}
{"text": "Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,"}
{"text": "As I am now unhappy; which is more"}
{"text": "Than history can pattern, though devised"}

{"text": "A fellow of the royal bed, which owe"}
{"text": "A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,"}
{"text": "The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing"}
{"text": "To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore"}

{"text": "And only that I stand for. I appeal"}
{"text": "To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes"}
{"text": "Came to your court, how I was in your grace,"}
{"text": "How merited to be so; since he came,"}
{"text": "With what encounter so uncurrent I"}
{"text": "Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond"}
{"text": "The bound of honour, or in act or will"}
{"text": "That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts"}
{"text": "Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin"}
{"text": "Cry fie upon my grave!"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I ne'er heard yet"}
{"text": "That any of these bolder vices wanted"}
{"text": "Less impudence to gainsay what they did"}

{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "That's true enough;"}

{"text": "You will not own it."}

{"text": "More than mistress of"}

{"text": "I loved him as in honour he required,"}
{"text": "With such a kind of love as might become"}
{"text": "A lady like me, with a love even such,"}
{"text": "So and no other, as yourself commanded:"}

{"text": "I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd"}
{"text": "For me to try how: all I know of it"}
{"text": "Is that Camillo was an honest man;"}
{"text": "And why he left your court, the gods themselves,"}
{"text": "Wotting no more than I, are ignorant."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}

{"text": "Sir,"}

{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Your actions are my dreams;"}
{"text": "You had a bastard by Polixenes,"}
{"text": "And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--"}
{"text": "Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:"}
{"text": "Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as"}

{"text": "No father owning it,--which is, indeed,"}

{"text": "To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried"}
{"text": "Here to this place, i' the open air, before"}
{"text": "I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,"}
{"text": "Tell me what blessings I have here alive,"}
{"text": "That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed."}
{"text": "But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,"}

{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "O sir, I shall be hated to report it!"}
{"text": "The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear"}
{"text": "Of the queen's speed, is gone."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "How! gone!"}

{"text": "I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,"}
{"text": "New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,"}
{"text": "Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;"}
{"text": "For, being transported by my jealousies"}
{"text": "To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose"}
{"text": "Camillo for the minister to poison"}
{"text": "My friend Polixenes: which had been done,"}
{"text": "But that the good mind of Camillo tardied"}

{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?"}

{"text": "In leads or oils? what old or newer torture"}
{"text": "Must I receive, whose every word deserves"}
{"text": "To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny"}
{"text": "Together working with thy jealousies,"}
{"text": "Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle"}
{"text": "For girls of nine, O, think what they have done"}
{"text": "And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all"}
{"text": "Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it."}
{"text": "That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;"}
{"text": "That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant"}
{"text": "And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,"}
{"text": "Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,"}
{"text": "To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,"}
{"text": "More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon"}
{"text": "The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter"}
{"text": "To be or none or little; though a devil"}
{"text": "Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:"}
{"text": "Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death"}
{"text": "Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,"}
{"text": "Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart"}

{"text": "As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!"}
{"text": "Do not repent these things, for they are heavier"}
{"text": "Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee"}
{"text": "To nothing but despair. A thousand knees"}
{"text": "Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,"}
{"text": "Upon a barren mountain and still winter"}
{"text": "In storm perpetual, could not move the gods"}

{"text": "Say no more:"}

{"text": "I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much"}
{"text": "The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd"}
{"text": "To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help"}
{"text": "Should be past grief: do not receive affliction"}
{"text": "At my petition; I beseech you, rather"}
{"text": "Let me be punish'd, that have minded you"}
{"text": "Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege"}
{"text": "Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:"}
{"text": "The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--"}
{"text": "I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;"}
{"text": "I'll not remember you of my own lord,"}
{"text": "Who is lost too: take your patience to you,"}
{"text": "And I'll say nothing."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Thou didst speak but well"}
{"text": "When most the truth; which I receive much better"}
{"text": "Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me"}
{"text": "To the dead bodies of my queen and son:"}
{"text": "One grave shall be for both: upon them shall"}
{"text": "The causes of their death appear, unto"}
{"text": "Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit"}
{"text": "The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there"}
{"text": "Shall be my recreation: so long as nature"}
{"text": "Will bear up with this exercise, so long"}
{"text": "I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me"}
{"text": "Unto these sorrows."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}

{"text": "The deserts of Bohemia?"}
{"text": "Mariner:"}
{"text": "Ay, my lord: and fear"}
{"text": "We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly"}
{"text": "And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,"}
{"text": "The heavens with that we have in hand are angry"}
{"text": "And frown upon 's."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;"}
{"text": "Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before"}
{"text": "I call upon thee."}
{"text": "Mariner:"}
{"text": "Make your best haste, and go not"}
{"text": "Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;"}
{"text": "Besides, this place is famous for the creatures"}
{"text": "Of prey that keep upon't."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Go thou away:"}
{"text": "I'll follow instantly."}
{"text": "Mariner:"}
{"text": "I am glad at heart"}
{"text": "To be so rid o' the business."}
{"text": "ANTIGONUS:"}
{"text": "Come, poor babe:"}
{"text": "I have heard, but not believed,"}
{"text": "the spirits o' the dead"}
{"text": "May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother"}
{"text": "Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream"}
{"text": "So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"}
{"text": "Sometimes her head on one side, some another;"}
{"text": "I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"}
{"text": "So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,"}
{"text": "Like very sanctity, she did approach"}
{"text": "My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,"}
{"text": "And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes"}
{"text": "Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon"}
{"text": "Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,"}
{"text": "Since fate, against thy better disposition,"}
{"text": "Hath made thy person for the thrower-out"}
{"text": "Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,"}
{"text": "Places remote enough are in Bohemia,"}
{"text": "There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe"}
{"text": "Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,"}
{"text": "I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business"}
{"text": "Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see"}
{"text": "Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks"}
{"text": "She melted into air. Affrighted much,"}
{"text": "I did in time collect myself and thought"}
{"text": "This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:"}
{"text": "Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"}
{"text": "I will be squared by this. I do believe"}
{"text": "Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that"}
{"text": "Apollo would, this being indeed the issue"}
{"text": "Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,"}
{"text": "Either for life or death, upon the earth"}
{"text": "Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!"}
{"text": "There lie, and there thy character: there these;"}
{"text": "Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,"}
{"text": "And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,"}
{"text": "That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed"}
{"text": "To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,"}
{"text": "But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I"}
{"text": "To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!"}
{"text": "The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have"}
{"text": "A lullaby too rough: I never saw"}
{"text": "The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!"}
{"text": "Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:"}
{"text": "I am gone for ever."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "I would there were no age between sixteen and"}
{"text": "three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the"}
{"text": "rest; for there is nothing in the between but"}
{"text": "getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,"}
{"text": "stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but"}
{"text": "these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty"}
{"text": "hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my"}
{"text": "best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find"}
{"text": "than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by"}
{"text": "the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy"}
{"text": "will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very"}
{"text": "pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A"}
{"text": "pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:"}
{"text": "though I am not bookish, yet I can read"}
{"text": "waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been"}
{"text": "some stair-work, some trunk-work, some"}
{"text": "behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this"}
{"text": "than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for"}
{"text": "pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed"}
{"text": "but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Hilloa, loa!"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk"}
{"text": "on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What"}
{"text": "ailest thou, man?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!"}
{"text": "but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the"}
{"text": "sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust"}
{"text": "a bodkin's point."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Why, boy, how is it?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,"}
{"text": "how it takes up the shore! but that's not the"}
{"text": "point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!"}
{"text": "sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the"}
{"text": "ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon"}
{"text": "swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a"}
{"text": "cork into a hogshead. And then for the"}
{"text": "land-service, to see how the bear tore out his"}
{"text": "shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said"}
{"text": "his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an"}
{"text": "end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned"}
{"text": "it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the"}
{"text": "sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared"}
{"text": "and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than"}
{"text": "the sea or weather."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Name of mercy, when was this, boy?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these"}
{"text": "sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor"}
{"text": "the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it"}
{"text": "now."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "I would you had been by the ship side, to have"}
{"text": "helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,"}
{"text": "boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things"}
{"text": "dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for"}
{"text": "thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's"}
{"text": "child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;"}
{"text": "open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be"}
{"text": "rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:"}
{"text": "open't. What's within, boy?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth"}
{"text": "are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up"}
{"text": "with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way."}
{"text": "We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires"}
{"text": "nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good"}
{"text": "boy, the next way home."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see"}
{"text": "if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much"}
{"text": "he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they"}
{"text": "are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury"}
{"text": "it."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that"}
{"text": "which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the"}
{"text": "sight of him."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't."}
{"text": "Time:"}
{"text": "I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror"}
{"text": "Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,"}
{"text": "Now take upon me, in the name of Time,"}
{"text": "To use my wings. Impute it not a crime"}
{"text": "To me or my swift passage, that I slide"}
{"text": "O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried"}
{"text": "Of that wide gap, since it is in my power"}
{"text": "To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour"}
{"text": "To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass"}
{"text": "The same I am, ere ancient'st order was"}
{"text": "Or what is now received: I witness to"}
{"text": "The times that brought them in; so shall I do"}
{"text": "To the freshest things now reigning and make stale"}
{"text": "The glistering of this present, as my tale"}
{"text": "Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,"}
{"text": "I turn my glass and give my scene such growing"}
{"text": "As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,"}
{"text": "The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving"}
{"text": "That he shuts up himself, imagine me,"}
{"text": "Gentle spectators, that I now may be"}
{"text": "In fair Bohemia, and remember well,"}
{"text": "I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel"}
{"text": "I now name to you; and with speed so pace"}
{"text": "To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace"}
{"text": "Equal with wondering: what of her ensues"}
{"text": "I list not prophecy; but let Time's news"}
{"text": "Be known when 'tis brought forth."}
{"text": "A shepherd's daughter,"}
{"text": "And what to her adheres, which follows after,"}
{"text": "Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,"}
{"text": "If ever you have spent time worse ere now;"}
{"text": "If never, yet that Time himself doth say"}
{"text": "He wishes earnestly you never may."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:"}

{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though"}
{"text": "I have for the most part been aired abroad, I"}
{"text": "desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent"}
{"text": "king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling"}
{"text": "sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to"}
{"text": "think so, which is another spur to my departure."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of"}
{"text": "thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of"}
{"text": "thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to"}
{"text": "have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having"}
{"text": "made me businesses which none without thee can"}
{"text": "sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute"}
{"text": "them thyself or take away with thee the very"}
{"text": "services thou hast done; which if I have not enough"}
{"text": "considered, as too much I cannot, to be more"}
{"text": "thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit"}

{"text": "penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,"}
{"text": "my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen"}
{"text": "and children are even now to be afresh lamented."}
{"text": "Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my"}
{"text": "son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not"}
{"text": "being gracious, than they are in losing them when"}
{"text": "they have approved their virtues."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What"}
{"text": "his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I"}
{"text": "have missingly noted, he is of late much retired"}
{"text": "from court and is less frequent to his princely"}
{"text": "exercises than formerly he hath appeared."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some"}
{"text": "care; so far that I have eyes under my service which"}
{"text": "look upon his removedness; from whom I have this"}
{"text": "intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a"}
{"text": "most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from"}
{"text": "very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his"}
{"text": "neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a"}
{"text": "daughter of most rare note: the report of her is"}
{"text": "extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I"}
{"text": "fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou"}
{"text": "shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not"}
{"text": "appearing what we are, have some question with the"}
{"text": "shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not"}
{"text": "uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither."}
{"text": "Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and"}
{"text": "lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I willingly obey your command."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "When daffodils begin to peer,"}
{"text": "With heigh! the doxy over the dale,"}
{"text": "Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;"}
{"text": "For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale."}
{"text": "The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,"}
{"text": "With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!"}
{"text": "Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;"}
{"text": "For a quart of ale is a dish for a king."}
{"text": "The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,"}
{"text": "With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,"}
{"text": "Are summer songs for me and my aunts,"}
{"text": "While we lie tumbling in the hay."}
{"text": "I have served Prince Florizel and in my time"}
{"text": "wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:"}
{"text": "But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?"}
{"text": "The pale moon shines by night:"}
{"text": "And when I wander here and there,"}
{"text": "I then do most go right."}
{"text": "If tinkers may have leave to live,"}
{"text": "And bear the sow-skin budget,"}
{"text": "Then my account I well may, give,"}
{"text": "And in the stocks avouch it."}
{"text": "My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to"}
{"text": "lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who"}
{"text": "being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise"}
{"text": "a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and"}
{"text": "drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is"}
{"text": "the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful"}
{"text": "on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to"}
{"text": "me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought"}
{"text": "of it. A prize! a prize!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod"}
{"text": "yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred"}
{"text": "shorn. what comes the wool to?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am"}
{"text": "I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound"}
{"text": "of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will"}
{"text": "this sister of mine do with rice? But my father"}
{"text": "hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it"}
{"text": "on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for"}
{"text": "the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good"}
{"text": "ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but"}
{"text": "one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to"}
{"text": "horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden"}
{"text": "pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;"}
{"text": "nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I"}
{"text": "may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of"}
{"text": "raisins o' the sun."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O that ever I was born!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "I' the name of me--"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and"}
{"text": "then, death, death!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay"}
{"text": "on thee, rather than have these off."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more"}
{"text": "than the stripes I have received, which are mighty"}
{"text": "ones and millions."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a"}
{"text": "great matter."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel"}
{"text": "ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon"}
{"text": "me."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "What, by a horseman, or a footman?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "A footman, sweet sir, a footman."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he"}
{"text": "has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,"}
{"text": "it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,"}
{"text": "I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O, good sir, tenderly, O!"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Alas, poor soul!"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my"}

{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "How now! canst stand?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have"}
{"text": "a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,"}
{"text": "unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or"}
{"text": "any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;"}
{"text": "that kills my heart."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with"}
{"text": "troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the"}
{"text": "prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his"}
{"text": "virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped"}
{"text": "out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay"}
{"text": "there; and yet it will no more but abide."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he"}
{"text": "hath been since an ape-bearer; then a"}
{"text": "process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a"}
{"text": "motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's"}
{"text": "wife within a mile where my land and living lies;"}
{"text": "and, having flown over many knavish professions, he"}
{"text": "settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts"}
{"text": "wakes, fairs and bear-baitings."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that"}
{"text": "put me into this apparel."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had"}
{"text": "but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am"}
{"text": "false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "How do you now?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and"}
{"text": "walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace"}
{"text": "softly towards my kinsman's."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Shall I bring thee on the way?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our"}
{"text": "sheep-shearing."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Prosper you, sweet sir!"}
{"text": "Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice."}
{"text": "I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I"}
{"text": "make not this cheat bring out another and the"}
{"text": "shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name"}
{"text": "put in the book of virtue!"}
{"text": "Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,"}

{"text": "A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,"}
{"text": "Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,"}
{"text": "As I seem now. Their transformations"}
{"text": "Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,"}

{"text": "Yet nature is made better by no mean"}

{"text": "A gentler scion to the wildest stock,"}
{"text": "And make conceive a bark of baser kind"}

{"text": "Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,"}
{"text": "For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall"}
{"text": "From Dis's waggon! daffodils,"}
{"text": "That come before the swallow dares, and take"}
{"text": "The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,"}
{"text": "But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes"}
{"text": "Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses"}
{"text": "That die unmarried, ere they can behold"}
{"text": "Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady"}
{"text": "Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and"}

{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "They call him Doricles; and boasts himself"}
{"text": "To have a worthy feeding: but I have it"}
{"text": "Upon his own report and I believe it;"}

{"text": "I think so too; for never gazed the moon"}

{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "She dances featly."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "So she does any thing; though I report it,"}

{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the"}

{"text": "several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he"}
{"text": "utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's"}
{"text": "ears grew to his tunes."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "He could never come better; he shall come in. I"}

{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no"}

{"text": "Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way"}
{"text": "and lost all my money?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;"}
{"text": "therefore it behoves men to be wary."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "What hast here? ballads?"}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'"}
{"text": "life, for then we are sure they are true."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's"}
{"text": "wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a"}
{"text": "burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and"}
{"text": "toads carbonadoed."}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "Is it true, think you?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Very true, and but a month old."}
{"text": "DORCAS:"}
{"text": "Bless me from marrying a usurer!"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress"}
{"text": "Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were"}
{"text": "present. Why should I carry lies abroad?"}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "Pray you now, buy it."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe"}
{"text": "ballads; we'll buy the other things anon."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon"}
{"text": "the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,"}
{"text": "forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this"}
{"text": "ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was"}
{"text": "thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold"}
{"text": "fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that"}
{"text": "loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true."}
{"text": "DORCAS:"}
{"text": "Is it true too, think you?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than"}
{"text": "my pack will hold."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Lay it by too: another."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one."}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "Let's have some merry ones."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to"}
{"text": "the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's"}
{"text": "scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in"}
{"text": "request, I can tell you."}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou"}

{"text": "DORCAS:"}
{"text": "We had the tune on't a month ago."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my"}

{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}

{"text": "Whither?"}
{"text": "MOPSA:"}
{"text": "O, whither?"}
{"text": "DORCAS:"}
{"text": "Whither?"}

{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Neither."}
{"text": "DORCAS:"}

{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Neither."}

{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my"}

{"text": "not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after"}
{"text": "me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's"}
{"text": "have the first choice. Follow me, girls."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "And you shall pay well for 'em."}
{"text": "Will you buy any tape,"}
{"text": "Or lace for your cape,"}
{"text": "My dainty duck, my dear-a?"}
{"text": "Any silk, any thread,"}
{"text": "Any toys for your head,"}
{"text": "Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?"}
{"text": "Come to the pedlar;"}
{"text": "Money's a medler."}
{"text": "That doth utter all men's ware-a."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,"}
{"text": "three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made"}
{"text": "themselves all men of hair, they call themselves"}
{"text": "Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches"}
{"text": "say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are"}
{"text": "not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it"}
{"text": "be not too rough for some that know little but"}
{"text": "bowling, it will please plentifully."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much"}
{"text": "homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see"}
{"text": "these four threes of herdsmen."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath"}
{"text": "danced before the king; and not the worst of the"}
{"text": "three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Leave your prating: since these good men are"}
{"text": "pleased, let them come in; but quickly now."}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "Why, they stay at door, sir."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter."}
{"text": "Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them."}
{"text": "He's simple and tells much."}
{"text": "How now, fair shepherd!"}
{"text": "Your heart is full of something that does take"}
{"text": "Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young"}
{"text": "And handed love as you do, I was wont"}
{"text": "To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd"}
{"text": "The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it"}
{"text": "To her acceptance; you have let him go"}
{"text": "And nothing marted with him. If your lass"}
{"text": "Interpretation should abuse and call this"}
{"text": "Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited"}
{"text": "For a reply, at least if you make a care"}
{"text": "Of happy holding her."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Old sir, I know"}
{"text": "She prizes not such trifles as these are:"}
{"text": "The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd"}
{"text": "Up in my heart; which I have given already,"}
{"text": "But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life"}
{"text": "Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,"}
{"text": "Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,"}
{"text": "As soft as dove's down and as white as it,"}
{"text": "Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd"}
{"text": "snow that's bolted"}
{"text": "By the northern blasts twice o'er."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "What follows this?"}
{"text": "How prettily the young swain seems to wash"}
{"text": "The hand was fair before! I have put you out:"}
{"text": "But to your protestation; let me hear"}
{"text": "What you profess."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Do, and be witness to 't."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "And this my neighbour too?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "And he, and more"}
{"text": "Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:"}
{"text": "That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,"}
{"text": "Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth"}
{"text": "That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge"}
{"text": "More than was ever man's, I would not prize them"}
{"text": "Without her love; for her employ them all;"}
{"text": "Commend them and condemn them to her service"}
{"text": "Or to their own perdition."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Fairly offer'd."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "This shows a sound affection."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "But, my daughter,"}
{"text": "Say you the like to him?"}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "I cannot speak"}
{"text": "So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:"}
{"text": "By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out"}
{"text": "The purity of his."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Take hands, a bargain!"}
{"text": "And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:"}
{"text": "I give my daughter to him, and will make"}
{"text": "Her portion equal his."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "O, that must be"}
{"text": "I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,"}
{"text": "I shall have more than you can dream of yet;"}
{"text": "Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,"}
{"text": "Contract us 'fore these witnesses."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Come, your hand;"}
{"text": "And, daughter, yours."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;"}
{"text": "Have you a father?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "I have: but what of him?"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Knows he of this?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "He neither does nor shall."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Methinks a father"}
{"text": "Is at the nuptial of his son a guest"}
{"text": "That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,"}
{"text": "Is not your father grown incapable"}
{"text": "Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid"}
{"text": "With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?"}
{"text": "Know man from man? dispute his own estate?"}
{"text": "Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing"}
{"text": "But what he did being childish?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "No, good sir;"}
{"text": "He has his health and ampler strength indeed"}
{"text": "Than most have of his age."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "By my white beard,"}
{"text": "You offer him, if this be so, a wrong"}
{"text": "Something unfilial: reason my son"}
{"text": "Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason"}
{"text": "The father, all whose joy is nothing else"}
{"text": "But fair posterity, should hold some counsel"}
{"text": "In such a business."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "I yield all this;"}
{"text": "But for some other reasons, my grave sir,"}
{"text": "Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint"}
{"text": "My father of this business."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Let him know't."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "He shall not."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Prithee, let him."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "No, he must not."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve"}
{"text": "At knowing of thy choice."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Come, come, he must not."}
{"text": "Mark our contract."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Mark your divorce, young sir,"}
{"text": "Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base"}
{"text": "To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,"}
{"text": "That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,"}
{"text": "I am sorry that by hanging thee I can"}
{"text": "But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece"}
{"text": "Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know"}
{"text": "The royal fool thou copest with,--"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "O, my heart!"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made"}
{"text": "More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,"}
{"text": "If I may ever know thou dost but sigh"}
{"text": "That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never"}
{"text": "I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;"}
{"text": "Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,"}
{"text": "Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:"}
{"text": "Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,"}
{"text": "Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee"}
{"text": "From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--"}
{"text": "Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,"}
{"text": "That makes himself, but for our honour therein,"}
{"text": "Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou"}
{"text": "These rural latches to his entrance open,"}
{"text": "Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,"}
{"text": "I will devise a death as cruel for thee"}
{"text": "As thou art tender to't."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "Even here undone!"}
{"text": "I was not much afeard; for once or twice"}
{"text": "I was about to speak and tell him plainly,"}
{"text": "The selfsame sun that shines upon his court"}
{"text": "Hides not his visage from our cottage but"}
{"text": "Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?"}
{"text": "I told you what would come of this: beseech you,"}
{"text": "Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--"}
{"text": "Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,"}
{"text": "But milk my ewes and weep."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, father!"}
{"text": "Speak ere thou diest."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "I cannot speak, nor think"}
{"text": "Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!"}
{"text": "You have undone a man of fourscore three,"}
{"text": "That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,"}
{"text": "To die upon the bed my father died,"}
{"text": "To lie close by his honest bones: but now"}
{"text": "Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me"}
{"text": "Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,"}
{"text": "That knew'st this was the prince,"}
{"text": "and wouldst adventure"}
{"text": "To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!"}
{"text": "If I might die within this hour, I have lived"}
{"text": "To die when I desire."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Why look you so upon me?"}
{"text": "I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,"}
{"text": "But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;"}
{"text": "More straining on for plucking back, not following"}
{"text": "My leash unwillingly."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Gracious my lord,"}
{"text": "You know your father's temper: at this time"}
{"text": "He will allow no speech, which I do guess"}
{"text": "You do not purpose to him; and as hardly"}
{"text": "Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:"}
{"text": "Then, till the fury of his highness settle,"}
{"text": "Come not before him."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "I not purpose it."}
{"text": "I think, Camillo?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Even he, my lord."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "How often have I told you 'twould be thus!"}
{"text": "How often said, my dignity would last"}
{"text": "But till 'twere known!"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "It cannot fail but by"}
{"text": "The violation of my faith; and then"}
{"text": "Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together"}
{"text": "And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:"}
{"text": "From my succession wipe me, father; I"}
{"text": "Am heir to my affection."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Be advised."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "I am, and by my fancy: if my reason"}
{"text": "Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;"}
{"text": "If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,"}
{"text": "Do bid it welcome."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "This is desperate, sir."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;"}
{"text": "I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,"}
{"text": "Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may"}
{"text": "Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or"}
{"text": "The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides"}
{"text": "In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath"}
{"text": "To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,"}
{"text": "As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,"}
{"text": "When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not"}
{"text": "To see him any more,--cast your good counsels"}
{"text": "Upon his passion; let myself and fortune"}
{"text": "Tug for the time to come. This you may know"}
{"text": "And so deliver, I am put to sea"}
{"text": "With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;"}
{"text": "And most opportune to our need I have"}
{"text": "A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared"}
{"text": "For this design. What course I mean to hold"}
{"text": "Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor"}
{"text": "Concern me the reporting."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "O my lord!"}
{"text": "I would your spirit were easier for advice,"}
{"text": "Or stronger for your need."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Hark, Perdita"}
{"text": "I'll hear you by and by."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "He's irremoveable,"}
{"text": "Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if"}
{"text": "His going I could frame to serve my turn,"}
{"text": "Save him from danger, do him love and honour,"}
{"text": "Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia"}
{"text": "And that unhappy king, my master, whom"}
{"text": "I so much thirst to see."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Now, good Camillo;"}
{"text": "I am so fraught with curious business that"}
{"text": "I leave out ceremony."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Sir, I think"}
{"text": "You have heard of my poor services, i' the love"}
{"text": "That I have borne your father?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Very nobly"}
{"text": "Have you deserved: it is my father's music"}
{"text": "To speak your deeds, not little of his care"}
{"text": "To have them recompensed as thought on."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Well, my lord,"}
{"text": "If you may please to think I love the king"}
{"text": "And through him what is nearest to him, which is"}
{"text": "Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:"}
{"text": "If your more ponderous and settled project"}
{"text": "May suffer alteration, on mine honour,"}
{"text": "I'll point you where you shall have such receiving"}
{"text": "As shall become your highness; where you may"}
{"text": "Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,"}
{"text": "There's no disjunction to be made, but by--"}
{"text": "As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,"}
{"text": "And, with my best endeavours in your absence,"}
{"text": "Your discontenting father strive to qualify"}
{"text": "And bring him up to liking."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "How, Camillo,"}
{"text": "May this, almost a miracle, be done?"}
{"text": "That I may call thee something more than man"}
{"text": "And after that trust to thee."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Have you thought on"}
{"text": "A place whereto you'll go?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Not any yet:"}
{"text": "But as the unthought-on accident is guilty"}
{"text": "To what we wildly do, so we profess"}
{"text": "Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies"}
{"text": "Of every wind that blows."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Then list to me:"}
{"text": "This follows, if you will not change your purpose"}
{"text": "But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,"}
{"text": "And there present yourself and your fair princess,"}
{"text": "For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:"}
{"text": "She shall be habited as it becomes"}
{"text": "The partner of your bed. Methinks I see"}
{"text": "Leontes opening his free arms and weeping"}
{"text": "His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,"}
{"text": "As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands"}
{"text": "Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him"}
{"text": "'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one"}
{"text": "He chides to hell and bids the other grow"}
{"text": "Faster than thought or time."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Worthy Camillo,"}
{"text": "What colour for my visitation shall I"}
{"text": "Hold up before him?"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Sent by the king your father"}
{"text": "To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,"}
{"text": "The manner of your bearing towards him, with"}
{"text": "What you as from your father shall deliver,"}
{"text": "Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:"}
{"text": "The which shall point you forth at every sitting"}
{"text": "What you must say; that he shall not perceive"}
{"text": "But that you have your father's bosom there"}
{"text": "And speak his very heart."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "I am bound to you:"}
{"text": "There is some sap in this."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "A cause more promising"}
{"text": "Than a wild dedication of yourselves"}
{"text": "To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain"}
{"text": "To miseries enough; no hope to help you,"}
{"text": "But as you shake off one to take another;"}
{"text": "Nothing so certain as your anchors, who"}
{"text": "Do their best office, if they can but stay you"}
{"text": "Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know"}
{"text": "Prosperity's the very bond of love,"}
{"text": "Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together"}
{"text": "Affliction alters."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "One of these is true:"}
{"text": "I think affliction may subdue the cheek,"}
{"text": "But not take in the mind."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Yea, say you so?"}
{"text": "There shall not at your father's house these"}
{"text": "seven years"}
{"text": "Be born another such."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "My good Camillo,"}
{"text": "She is as forward of her breeding as"}
{"text": "She is i' the rear our birth."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "I cannot say 'tis pity"}
{"text": "She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress"}
{"text": "To most that teach."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "Your pardon, sir; for this"}
{"text": "I'll blush you thanks."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "My prettiest Perdita!"}
{"text": "But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,"}
{"text": "Preserver of my father, now of me,"}
{"text": "The medicine of our house, how shall we do?"}
{"text": "We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,"}
{"text": "Nor shall appear in Sicilia."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "My lord,"}
{"text": "Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes"}
{"text": "Do all lie there: it shall be so my care"}
{"text": "To have you royally appointed as if"}
{"text": "The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,"}
{"text": "That you may know you shall not want, one word."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his"}
{"text": "sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold"}
{"text": "all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a"}
{"text": "ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,"}
{"text": "knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,"}
{"text": "to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who"}
{"text": "should buy first, as if my trinkets had been"}
{"text": "hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:"}
{"text": "by which means I saw whose purse was best in"}
{"text": "picture; and what I saw, to my good use I"}
{"text": "remembered. My clown, who wants but something to"}
{"text": "be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the"}
{"text": "wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes"}
{"text": "till he had both tune and words; which so drew the"}
{"text": "rest of the herd to me that all their other senses"}
{"text": "stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it"}
{"text": "was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a"}
{"text": "purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in"}
{"text": "chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,"}
{"text": "and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this"}
{"text": "time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their"}
{"text": "festival purses; and had not the old man come in"}
{"text": "with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's"}
{"text": "son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not"}
{"text": "left a purse alive in the whole army."}

{"text": "Nay, but my letters, by this means being there"}
{"text": "So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--"}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Shall satisfy your father."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "Happy be you!"}
{"text": "All that you speak shows fair."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Who have we here?"}
{"text": "We'll make an instrument of this, omit"}
{"text": "Nothing may give us aid."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "If they have overheard me now, why, hanging."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear"}
{"text": "not, man; here's no harm intended to thee."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I am a poor fellow, sir."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from"}
{"text": "thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must"}
{"text": "make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,"}
{"text": "--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and"}
{"text": "change garments with this gentleman: though the"}
{"text": "pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,"}
{"text": "there's some boot."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I am a poor fellow, sir."}
{"text": "I know ye well enough."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half"}
{"text": "flayed already."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Are you in earnest, sir?"}
{"text": "I smell the trick on't."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Dispatch, I prithee."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with"}
{"text": "conscience take it."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Unbuckle, unbuckle."}
{"text": "Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy"}
{"text": "Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself"}
{"text": "Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat"}
{"text": "And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,"}
{"text": "Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken"}
{"text": "The truth of your own seeming; that you may--"}
{"text": "For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard"}
{"text": "Get undescried."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "I see the play so lies"}
{"text": "That I must bear a part."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "No remedy."}
{"text": "Have you done there?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Should I now meet my father,"}
{"text": "He would not call me son."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "Nay, you shall have no hat."}
{"text": "Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Adieu, sir."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!"}
{"text": "Pray you, a word."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Fortune speed us!"}
{"text": "Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "The swifter speed the better."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I understand the business, I hear it: to have an"}
{"text": "open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is"}
{"text": "necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite"}
{"text": "also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see"}
{"text": "this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive."}
{"text": "What an exchange had this been without boot! What"}
{"text": "a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do"}
{"text": "this year connive at us, and we may do any thing"}
{"text": "extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of"}
{"text": "iniquity, stealing away from his father with his"}
{"text": "clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of"}
{"text": "honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not"}
{"text": "do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;"}
{"text": "and therein am I constant to my profession."}
{"text": "Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:"}
{"text": "every lane's end, every shop, church, session,"}
{"text": "hanging, yields a careful man work."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "See, see; what a man you are now!"}
{"text": "There is no other way but to tell the king"}
{"text": "she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Nay, but hear me."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Nay, but hear me."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Go to, then."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh"}
{"text": "and blood has not offended the king; and so your"}
{"text": "flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show"}
{"text": "those things you found about her, those secret"}
{"text": "things, all but what she has with her: this being"}
{"text": "done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his"}
{"text": "son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,"}
{"text": "neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make"}
{"text": "me the king's brother-in-law."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you"}
{"text": "could have been to him and then your blood had been"}
{"text": "the dearer by I know how much an ounce."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Well, let us to the king: there is that in this"}
{"text": "fardel will make him scratch his beard."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Pray heartily he be at palace."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "To the palace, an it like your worship."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition"}
{"text": "of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your"}
{"text": "names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any"}
{"text": "thing that is fitting to be known, discover."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "We are but plain fellows, sir."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no"}
{"text": "lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they"}
{"text": "often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for"}
{"text": "it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore"}
{"text": "they do not give us the lie."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Your worship had like to have given us one, if you"}
{"text": "had not taken yourself with the manner."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest"}
{"text": "thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?"}
{"text": "hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?"}
{"text": "receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I"}
{"text": "not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,"}
{"text": "for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy"}
{"text": "business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier"}
{"text": "cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck"}
{"text": "back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to"}
{"text": "open thy affair."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "My business, sir, is to the king."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "What advocate hast thou to him?"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "I know not, an't like you."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you"}
{"text": "have none."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "How blessed are we that are not simple men!"}
{"text": "Yet nature might have made me as these are,"}
{"text": "Therefore I will not disdain."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "This cannot be but a great courtier."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "His garments are rich, but he wears"}
{"text": "them not handsomely."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:"}
{"text": "a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking"}
{"text": "on's teeth."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?"}
{"text": "Wherefore that box?"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,"}
{"text": "which none must know but the king; and which he"}
{"text": "shall know within this hour, if I may come to the"}
{"text": "speech of him."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Age, thou hast lost thy labour."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Why, sir?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a"}
{"text": "new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,"}
{"text": "if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must"}
{"text": "know the king is full of grief."}
{"text": "Shepard:"}
{"text": "So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have"}
{"text": "married a shepherd's daughter."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:"}
{"text": "the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall"}
{"text": "feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Think you so, sir?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy"}
{"text": "and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to"}
{"text": "him, though removed fifty times, shall all come"}
{"text": "under the hangman: which though it be great pity,"}
{"text": "yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a"}
{"text": "ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into"}
{"text": "grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death"}
{"text": "is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a"}
{"text": "sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't"}
{"text": "like you, sir?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then"}
{"text": "'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a"}
{"text": "wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters"}
{"text": "and a dram dead; then recovered again with"}
{"text": "aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as"}
{"text": "he is, and in the hottest day prognostication"}
{"text": "proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the"}
{"text": "sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he"}
{"text": "is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what"}
{"text": "talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries"}
{"text": "are to be smiled at, their offences being so"}
{"text": "capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain"}
{"text": "men, what you have to the king: being something"}
{"text": "gently considered, I'll bring you where he is"}
{"text": "aboard, tender your persons to his presence,"}
{"text": "whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man"}
{"text": "besides the king to effect your suits, here is man"}
{"text": "shall do it."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "He seems to be of great authority: close with him,"}
{"text": "give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn"}
{"text": "bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show"}
{"text": "the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,"}
{"text": "and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for"}
{"text": "us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much"}
{"text": "more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "After I have done what I promised?"}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful"}
{"text": "one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,"}
{"text": "he'll be made an example."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show"}
{"text": "our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your"}
{"text": "daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I"}
{"text": "will give you as much as this old man does when the"}
{"text": "business is performed, and remain, as he says, your"}
{"text": "pawn till it be brought you."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;"}
{"text": "go on the right hand: I will but look upon the"}
{"text": "hedge and follow you."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would"}
{"text": "not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am"}
{"text": "courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means"}
{"text": "to do the prince my master good; which who knows how"}
{"text": "that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring"}
{"text": "these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he"}
{"text": "think it fit to shore them again and that the"}
{"text": "complaint they have to the king concerns him"}
{"text": "nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far"}
{"text": "officious; for I am proof against that title and"}
{"text": "what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present"}
{"text": "them: there may be matter in it."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd"}
{"text": "A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,"}
{"text": "Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down"}
{"text": "More penitence than done trespass: at the last,"}
{"text": "Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;"}
{"text": "With them forgive yourself."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Whilst I remember"}
{"text": "Her and her virtues, I cannot forget"}
{"text": "My blemishes in them, and so still think of"}
{"text": "The wrong I did myself; which was so much,"}
{"text": "That heirless it hath made my kingdom and"}
{"text": "Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man"}
{"text": "Bred his hopes out of."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "True, too true, my lord:"}
{"text": "If, one by one, you wedded all the world,"}
{"text": "Or from the all that are took something good,"}
{"text": "To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd"}
{"text": "Would be unparallel'd."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I think so. Kill'd!"}
{"text": "She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me"}
{"text": "Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter"}
{"text": "Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,"}
{"text": "Say so but seldom."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "Not at all, good lady:"}
{"text": "You might have spoken a thousand things that would"}
{"text": "Have done the time more benefit and graced"}
{"text": "Your kindness better."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "You are one of those"}
{"text": "Would have him wed again."}
{"text": "DION:"}
{"text": "If you would not so,"}
{"text": "You pity not the state, nor the remembrance"}
{"text": "Of his most sovereign name; consider little"}
{"text": "What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,"}
{"text": "May drop upon his kingdom and devour"}
{"text": "Incertain lookers on. What were more holy"}
{"text": "Than to rejoice the former queen is well?"}
{"text": "What holier than, for royalty's repair,"}
{"text": "For present comfort and for future good,"}
{"text": "To bless the bed of majesty again"}
{"text": "With a sweet fellow to't?"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "There is none worthy,"}
{"text": "Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods"}
{"text": "Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;"}
{"text": "For has not the divine Apollo said,"}
{"text": "Is't not the tenor of his oracle,"}
{"text": "That King Leontes shall not have an heir"}
{"text": "Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,"}
{"text": "Is all as monstrous to our human reason"}
{"text": "As my Antigonus to break his grave"}
{"text": "And come again to me; who, on my life,"}
{"text": "Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel"}
{"text": "My lord should to the heavens be contrary,"}
{"text": "Oppose against their wills."}
{"text": "Care not for issue;"}
{"text": "The crown will find an heir: great Alexander"}
{"text": "Left his to the worthiest; so his successor"}
{"text": "Was like to be the best."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Good Paulina,"}
{"text": "Who hast the memory of Hermione,"}
{"text": "I know, in honour, O, that ever I"}
{"text": "Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,"}
{"text": "I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,"}
{"text": "Have taken treasure from her lips--"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "And left them"}
{"text": "More rich for what they yielded."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Thou speak'st truth."}
{"text": "No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,"}
{"text": "And better used, would make her sainted spirit"}
{"text": "Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,"}
{"text": "Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,"}
{"text": "And begin, 'Why to me?'"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Had she such power,"}
{"text": "She had just cause."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "She had; and would incense me"}
{"text": "To murder her I married."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I should so."}
{"text": "Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark"}
{"text": "Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't"}
{"text": "You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears"}
{"text": "Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd"}
{"text": "Should be 'Remember mine.'"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Stars, stars,"}
{"text": "And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;"}
{"text": "I'll have no wife, Paulina."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Will you swear"}
{"text": "Never to marry but by my free leave?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "You tempt him over-much."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Unless another,"}
{"text": "As like Hermione as is her picture,"}
{"text": "Affront his eye."}
{"text": "CLEOMENES:"}
{"text": "Good madam,--"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I have done."}
{"text": "Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,"}
{"text": "No remedy, but you will,--give me the office"}
{"text": "To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young"}
{"text": "As was your former; but she shall be such"}
{"text": "As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,"}
{"text": "it should take joy"}
{"text": "To see her in your arms."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "My true Paulina,"}
{"text": "We shall not marry till thou bid'st us."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "That"}
{"text": "Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;"}
{"text": "Never till then."}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,"}
{"text": "Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she"}
{"text": "The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access"}
{"text": "To your high presence."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "What with him? he comes not"}
{"text": "Like to his father's greatness: his approach,"}
{"text": "So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us"}
{"text": "'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced"}
{"text": "By need and accident. What train?"}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "But few,"}
{"text": "And those but mean."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "His princess, say you, with him?"}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,"}
{"text": "That e'er the sun shone bright on."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "O Hermione,"}
{"text": "As every present time doth boast itself"}
{"text": "Above a better gone, so must thy grave"}
{"text": "Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself"}
{"text": "Have said and writ so, but your writing now"}
{"text": "Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,"}
{"text": "Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse"}
{"text": "Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,"}
{"text": "To say you have seen a better."}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Pardon, madam:"}
{"text": "The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--"}
{"text": "The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,"}
{"text": "Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,"}
{"text": "Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal"}
{"text": "Of all professors else, make proselytes"}
{"text": "Of who she but bid follow."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "How! not women?"}
{"text": "Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Women will love her, that she is a woman"}
{"text": "More worth than any man; men, that she is"}
{"text": "The rarest of all women."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Go, Cleomenes;"}
{"text": "Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,"}
{"text": "Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange"}
{"text": "He thus should steal upon us."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Had our prince,"}
{"text": "Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd"}
{"text": "Well with this lord: there was not full a month"}
{"text": "Between their births."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st"}
{"text": "He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,"}
{"text": "When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches"}
{"text": "Will bring me to consider that which may"}
{"text": "Unfurnish me of reason. They are come."}
{"text": "Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;"}
{"text": "For she did print your royal father off,"}
{"text": "Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,"}
{"text": "Your father's image is so hit in you,"}
{"text": "His very air, that I should call you brother,"}
{"text": "As I did him, and speak of something wildly"}
{"text": "By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!"}
{"text": "And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!"}
{"text": "I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth"}
{"text": "Might thus have stood begetting wonder as"}
{"text": "You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--"}
{"text": "All mine own folly--the society,"}
{"text": "Amity too, of your brave father, whom,"}
{"text": "Though bearing misery, I desire my life"}
{"text": "Once more to look on him."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "By his command"}
{"text": "Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him"}
{"text": "Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,"}
{"text": "Can send his brother: and, but infirmity"}
{"text": "Which waits upon worn times hath something seized"}
{"text": "His wish'd ability, he had himself"}
{"text": "The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his"}
{"text": "Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--"}
{"text": "He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres"}
{"text": "And those that bear them living."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O my brother,"}
{"text": "Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir"}
{"text": "Afresh within me, and these thy offices,"}
{"text": "So rarely kind, are as interpreters"}
{"text": "Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,"}
{"text": "As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too"}
{"text": "Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,"}
{"text": "At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,"}
{"text": "To greet a man not worth her pains, much less"}
{"text": "The adventure of her person?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Good my lord,"}
{"text": "She came from Libya."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Where the warlike Smalus,"}
{"text": "That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter"}
{"text": "His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,"}
{"text": "A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,"}
{"text": "To execute the charge my father gave me"}
{"text": "For visiting your highness: my best train"}
{"text": "I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;"}
{"text": "Who for Bohemia bend, to signify"}
{"text": "Not only my success in Libya, sir,"}
{"text": "But my arrival and my wife's in safety"}
{"text": "Here where we are."}

{"text": "So sacred as it is, I have done sin:"}
{"text": "For which the heavens, taking angry note,"}
{"text": "Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,"}
{"text": "As he from heaven merits it, with you"}
{"text": "Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,"}
{"text": "Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,"}
{"text": "Such goodly things as you!"}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Most noble sir,"}
{"text": "That which I shall report will bear no credit,"}

{"text": "Desires you to attach his son, who has--"}
{"text": "His dignity and duty both cast off--"}
{"text": "Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with"}
{"text": "A shepherd's daughter."}

{"text": "Where's Bohemia? speak."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Here in your city; I now came from him:"}
{"text": "I speak amazedly; and it becomes"}
{"text": "My marvel and my message. To your court"}
{"text": "Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,"}
{"text": "Of this fair couple, meets he on the way"}
{"text": "The father of this seeming lady and"}
{"text": "Her brother, having both their country quitted"}
{"text": "With this young prince."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Camillo has betray'd me;"}
{"text": "Whose honour and whose honesty till now"}
{"text": "Endured all weathers."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Lay't so to his charge:"}
{"text": "He's with the king your father."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Who? Camillo?"}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now"}
{"text": "Has these poor men in question. Never saw I"}
{"text": "Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;"}

{"text": "O my poor father!"}

{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "You are married?"}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}

{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "My lord,"}
{"text": "Is this the daughter of a king?"}

{"text": "Most sorry, you have broken from his liking"}
{"text": "Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry"}
{"text": "Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,"}
{"text": "That you might well enjoy her."}
{"text": "FLORIZEL:"}
{"text": "Dear, look up:"}
{"text": "Though Fortune, visible an enemy,"}
{"text": "Should chase us with my father, power no jot"}
{"text": "Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,"}
{"text": "Remember since you owed no more to time"}
{"text": "Than I do now: with thought of such affections,"}
{"text": "Step forth mine advocate; at your request"}
{"text": "My father will grant precious things as trifles."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,"}

{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Sir, my liege,"}
{"text": "Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month"}
{"text": "'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes"}
{"text": "Than what you look on now."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "I thought of her,"}
{"text": "Even in these looks I made."}
{"text": "But your petition"}
{"text": "Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:"}
{"text": "Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,"}
{"text": "I am friend to them and you: upon which errand"}
{"text": "I now go toward him; therefore follow me"}
{"text": "And mark what way I make: come, good my lord."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old"}
{"text": "shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:"}
{"text": "whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all"}
{"text": "commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I"}
{"text": "heard the shepherd say, he found the child."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I would most gladly know the issue of it."}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "I make a broken delivery of the business; but the"}
{"text": "changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were"}
{"text": "very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with"}
{"text": "staring on one another, to tear the cases of their"}
{"text": "eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language"}
{"text": "in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard"}
{"text": "of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable"}
{"text": "passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest"}
{"text": "beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not"}
{"text": "say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the"}
{"text": "extremity of the one, it must needs be."}
{"text": "Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more."}
{"text": "The news, Rogero?"}
{"text": "Second Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the"}
{"text": "king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is"}
{"text": "broken out within this hour that ballad-makers"}
{"text": "cannot be able to express it."}
{"text": "Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can"}
{"text": "deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news"}
{"text": "which is called true is so like an old tale, that"}
{"text": "the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king"}
{"text": "found his heir?"}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by"}
{"text": "circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you"}
{"text": "see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle"}
{"text": "of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,"}
{"text": "the letters of Antigonus found with it which they"}
{"text": "know to be his character, the majesty of the"}
{"text": "creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection"}
{"text": "of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,"}
{"text": "and many other evidences proclaim her with all"}
{"text": "certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see"}
{"text": "the meeting of the two kings?"}
{"text": "Second Gentleman:"}
{"text": "No."}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,"}
{"text": "cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one"}
{"text": "joy crown another, so and in such manner that it"}
{"text": "seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their"}
{"text": "joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,"}
{"text": "holding up of hands, with countenances of such"}
{"text": "distraction that they were to be known by garment,"}
{"text": "not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of"}
{"text": "himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that"}
{"text": "joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,"}
{"text": "thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then"}
{"text": "embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his"}
{"text": "daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old"}
{"text": "shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten"}
{"text": "conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such"}
{"text": "another encounter, which lames report to follow it"}
{"text": "and undoes description to do it."}
{"text": "Second Gentleman:"}
{"text": "What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried"}
{"text": "hence the child?"}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Like an old tale still, which will have matter to"}
{"text": "rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear"}
{"text": "open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this"}
{"text": "avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his"}
{"text": "innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a"}
{"text": "handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows."}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "What became of his bark and his followers?"}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and"}
{"text": "in the view of the shepherd: so that all the"}
{"text": "instruments which aided to expose the child were"}
{"text": "even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble"}
{"text": "combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in"}
{"text": "Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of"}
{"text": "her husband, another elevated that the oracle was"}
{"text": "fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,"}
{"text": "and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin"}
{"text": "her to her heart that she might no more be in danger"}
{"text": "of losing."}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "The dignity of this act was worth the audience of"}
{"text": "kings and princes; for by such was it acted."}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "One of the prettiest touches of all and that which"}
{"text": "angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not"}
{"text": "the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's"}
{"text": "death, with the manner how she came to't bravely"}
{"text": "confessed and lamented by the king, how"}
{"text": "attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one"}
{"text": "sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'"}
{"text": "I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my"}
{"text": "heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed"}
{"text": "colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world"}
{"text": "could have seen 't, the woe had been universal."}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Are they returned to the court?"}
{"text": "Third Gentleman:"}
{"text": "No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,"}
{"text": "which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many"}
{"text": "years in doing and now newly performed by that rare"}
{"text": "Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself"}
{"text": "eternity and could put breath into his work, would"}
{"text": "beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her"}
{"text": "ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that"}
{"text": "they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of"}
{"text": "answer: thither with all greediness of affection"}
{"text": "are they gone, and there they intend to sup."}
{"text": "Second Gentleman:"}
{"text": "I thought she had some great matter there in hand;"}
{"text": "for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever"}
{"text": "since the death of Hermione, visited that removed"}
{"text": "house. Shall we thither and with our company piece"}
{"text": "the rejoicing?"}
{"text": "First Gentleman:"}
{"text": "Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?"}
{"text": "every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:"}
{"text": "our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge."}
{"text": "Let's along."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,"}
{"text": "would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old"}
{"text": "man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard"}
{"text": "them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he"}
{"text": "at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,"}
{"text": "so he then took her to be, who began to be much"}
{"text": "sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of"}
{"text": "weather continuing, this mystery remained"}
{"text": "undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I"}
{"text": "been the finder out of this secret, it would not"}
{"text": "have relished among my other discredits."}
{"text": "Here come those I have done good to against my will,"}
{"text": "and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and"}
{"text": "daughters will be all gentlemen born."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me"}
{"text": "this other day, because I was no gentleman born."}
{"text": "See you these clothes? say you see them not and"}
{"text": "think me still no gentleman born: you were best say"}
{"text": "these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the"}
{"text": "lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "And so have I, boy."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my"}
{"text": "father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and"}
{"text": "called me brother; and then the two kings called my"}
{"text": "father brother; and then the prince my brother and"}
{"text": "the princess my sister called my father father; and"}
{"text": "so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like"}
{"text": "tears that ever we shed."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "We may live, son, to shed many more."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so"}
{"text": "preposterous estate as we are."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the"}
{"text": "faults I have committed to your worship and to give"}
{"text": "me your good report to the prince my master."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are"}
{"text": "gentlemen."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Thou wilt amend thy life?"}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "Ay, an it like your good worship."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou"}
{"text": "art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "You may say it, but not swear it."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and"}
{"text": "franklins say it, I'll swear it."}
{"text": "Shepherd:"}
{"text": "How if it be false, son?"}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear"}
{"text": "it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to"}
{"text": "the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and"}
{"text": "that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no"}
{"text": "tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be"}
{"text": "drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst"}
{"text": "be a tall fellow of thy hands."}
{"text": "AUTOLYCUS:"}
{"text": "I will prove so, sir, to my power."}
{"text": "Clown:"}
{"text": "Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not"}
{"text": "wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not"}
{"text": "being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings"}
{"text": "and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the"}
{"text": "queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy"}
{"text": "good masters."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort"}
{"text": "That I have had of thee!"}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "What, sovereign sir,"}
{"text": "I did not well I meant well. All my services"}
{"text": "You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,"}
{"text": "With your crown'd brother and these your contracted"}
{"text": "Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,"}
{"text": "It is a surplus of your grace, which never"}
{"text": "My life may last to answer."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O Paulina,"}
{"text": "We honour you with trouble: but we came"}
{"text": "To see the statue of our queen: your gallery"}
{"text": "Have we pass'd through, not without much content"}
{"text": "In many singularities; but we saw not"}
{"text": "That which my daughter came to look upon,"}
{"text": "The statue of her mother."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "As she lived peerless,"}
{"text": "So her dead likeness, I do well believe,"}
{"text": "Excels whatever yet you look'd upon"}
{"text": "Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it"}
{"text": "Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare"}
{"text": "To see the life as lively mock'd as ever"}
{"text": "Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well."}
{"text": "I like your silence, it the more shows off"}
{"text": "Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,"}
{"text": "Comes it not something near?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Her natural posture!"}
{"text": "Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed"}
{"text": "Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she"}
{"text": "In thy not chiding, for she was as tender"}
{"text": "As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,"}
{"text": "Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing"}
{"text": "So aged as this seems."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "O, not by much."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "So much the more our carver's excellence;"}
{"text": "Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her"}
{"text": "As she lived now."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "As now she might have done,"}
{"text": "So much to my good comfort, as it is"}
{"text": "Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,"}
{"text": "Even with such life of majesty, warm life,"}
{"text": "As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!"}
{"text": "I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me"}
{"text": "For being more stone than it? O royal piece,"}
{"text": "There's magic in thy majesty, which has"}
{"text": "My evils conjured to remembrance and"}
{"text": "From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,"}
{"text": "Standing like stone with thee."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "And give me leave,"}
{"text": "And do not say 'tis superstition, that"}
{"text": "I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,"}
{"text": "Dear queen, that ended when I but began,"}
{"text": "Give me that hand of yours to kiss."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "O, patience!"}
{"text": "The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,"}
{"text": "Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,"}
{"text": "So many summers dry; scarce any joy"}
{"text": "Did ever so long live; no sorrow"}
{"text": "But kill'd itself much sooner."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Dear my brother,"}
{"text": "Let him that was the cause of this have power"}
{"text": "To take off so much grief from you as he"}
{"text": "Will piece up in himself."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Indeed, my lord,"}
{"text": "If I had thought the sight of my poor image"}
{"text": "Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--"}
{"text": "I'ld not have show'd it."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Do not draw the curtain."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy"}
{"text": "May think anon it moves."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Let be, let be."}
{"text": "Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--"}
{"text": "What was he that did make it? See, my lord,"}
{"text": "Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins"}
{"text": "Did verily bear blood?"}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Masterly done:"}
{"text": "The very life seems warm upon her lip."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "The fixture of her eye has motion in't,"}
{"text": "As we are mock'd with art."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I'll draw the curtain:"}
{"text": "My lord's almost so far transported that"}
{"text": "He'll think anon it lives."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O sweet Paulina,"}
{"text": "Make me to think so twenty years together!"}
{"text": "No settled senses of the world can match"}
{"text": "The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but"}
{"text": "I could afflict you farther."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Do, Paulina;"}
{"text": "For this affliction has a taste as sweet"}
{"text": "As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,"}
{"text": "There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel"}
{"text": "Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,"}
{"text": "For I will kiss her."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Good my lord, forbear:"}
{"text": "The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;"}
{"text": "You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own"}
{"text": "With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "No, not these twenty years."}
{"text": "PERDITA:"}
{"text": "So long could I"}
{"text": "Stand by, a looker on."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Either forbear,"}
{"text": "Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you"}
{"text": "For more amazement. If you can behold it,"}
{"text": "I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"}
{"text": "And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--"}
{"text": "Which I protest against--I am assisted"}
{"text": "By wicked powers."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "What you can make her do,"}
{"text": "I am content to look on: what to speak,"}
{"text": "I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy"}
{"text": "To make her speak as move."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "It is required"}
{"text": "You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;"}
{"text": "On: those that think it is unlawful business"}
{"text": "I am about, let them depart."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "Proceed:"}
{"text": "No foot shall stir."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "Music, awake her; strike!"}
{"text": "'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;"}
{"text": "Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,"}
{"text": "I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,"}
{"text": "Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him"}
{"text": "Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:"}
{"text": "Start not; her actions shall be holy as"}
{"text": "You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her"}
{"text": "Until you see her die again; for then"}
{"text": "You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:"}
{"text": "When she was young you woo'd her; now in age"}
{"text": "Is she become the suitor?"}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O, she's warm!"}
{"text": "If this be magic, let it be an art"}
{"text": "Lawful as eating."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "She embraces him."}
{"text": "CAMILLO:"}
{"text": "She hangs about his neck:"}
{"text": "If she pertain to life let her speak too."}
{"text": "POLIXENES:"}
{"text": "Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,"}
{"text": "Or how stolen from the dead."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "That she is living,"}
{"text": "Were it but told you, should be hooted at"}
{"text": "Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,"}
{"text": "Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while."}
{"text": "Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel"}
{"text": "And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;"}
{"text": "Our Perdita is found."}
{"text": "HERMIONE:"}
{"text": "You gods, look down"}
{"text": "And from your sacred vials pour your graces"}
{"text": "Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own."}
{"text": "Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found"}
{"text": "Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,"}
{"text": "Knowing by Paulina that the oracle"}
{"text": "Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved"}
{"text": "Myself to see the issue."}
{"text": "PAULINA:"}
{"text": "There's time enough for that;"}
{"text": "Lest they desire upon this push to trouble"}
{"text": "Your joys with like relation. Go together,"}
{"text": "You precious winners all; your exultation"}
{"text": "Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,"}
{"text": "Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there"}
{"text": "My mate, that's never to be found again,"}
{"text": "Lament till I am lost."}
{"text": "LEONTES:"}
{"text": "O, peace, Paulina!"}
{"text": "Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,"}
{"text": "As I by thine a wife: this is a match,"}
{"text": "And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;"}
{"text": "But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,"}
{"text": "As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many"}
{"text": "A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--"}
{"text": "For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee"}
{"text": "An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,"}
{"text": "And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty"}
{"text": "Is richly noted and here justified"}
{"text": "By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place."}
{"text": "What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,"}
{"text": "That e'er I put between your holy looks"}
{"text": "My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,"}
{"text": "And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,"}

{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "A woman."}
{"text": "MISTRESS OVERDONE:"}

{"text": "Groping for trouts in a peculiar river."}
{"text": "MISTRESS OVERDONE:"}

{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down."}

{"text": "Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?"}
{"text": "Bear me to prison, where I am committed."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I do it not in evil disposition,"}

{"text": "Thus can the demigod Authority"}
{"text": "Make us pay down for our offence by weight"}
{"text": "The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;"}
{"text": "On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:"}
{"text": "As surfeit is the father of much fast,"}
{"text": "So every scope by the immoderate use"}
{"text": "Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,"}
{"text": "Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,"}
{"text": "A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would"}
{"text": "send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say"}
{"text": "the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom"}
{"text": "as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy"}
{"text": "offence, Claudio?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "What but to speak of would offend again."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "What, is't murder?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "No."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Lechery?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Call it so."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Away, sir! you must go."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "A hundred, if they'll do you any good."}
{"text": "Is lechery so look'd after?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract"}
{"text": "I got possession of Julietta's bed:"}
{"text": "You know the lady; she is fast my wife,"}
{"text": "Save that we do the denunciation lack"}
{"text": "Of outward order: this we came not to,"}
{"text": "Only for propagation of a dower"}
{"text": "Remaining in the coffer of her friends,"}
{"text": "From whom we thought it meet to hide our love"}
{"text": "Till time had made them for us. But it chances"}
{"text": "The stealth of our most mutual entertainment"}
{"text": "With character too gross is writ on Juliet."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "With child, perhaps?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Unhappily, even so."}
{"text": "And the new deputy now for the duke--"}
{"text": "Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,"}
{"text": "Or whether that the body public be"}
{"text": "A horse whereon the governor doth ride,"}
{"text": "Who, newly in the seat, that it may know"}
{"text": "He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;"}
{"text": "Whether the tyranny be in his place,"}
{"text": "Or in his emmence that fills it up,"}
{"text": "I stagger in:--but this new governor"}
{"text": "Awakes me all the enrolled penalties"}
{"text": "Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall"}
{"text": "So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round"}
{"text": "And none of them been worn; and, for a name,"}
{"text": "Now puts the drowsy and neglected act"}
{"text": "Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on"}
{"text": "thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,"}
{"text": "may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "I have done so, but he's not to be found."}
{"text": "I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:"}
{"text": "This day my sister should the cloister enter"}
{"text": "And there receive her approbation:"}
{"text": "Acquaint her with the danger of my state:"}
{"text": "Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends"}
{"text": "To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:"}
{"text": "I have great hope in that; for in her youth"}
{"text": "There is a prone and speechless dialect,"}
{"text": "Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art"}
{"text": "When she will play with reason and discourse,"}
{"text": "And well she can persuade."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the"}
{"text": "like, which else would stand under grievous"}
{"text": "imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I"}
{"text": "would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a"}
{"text": "game of tick-tack. I'll to her."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "I thank you, good friend Lucio."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Within two hours."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Come, officer, away!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "No, holy father; throw away that thought;"}
{"text": "Believe not that the dribbling dart of love"}
{"text": "Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee"}
{"text": "To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose"}
{"text": "More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends"}
{"text": "Of burning youth."}
{"text": "FRIAR THOMAS:"}
{"text": "May your grace speak of it?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "My holy sir, none better knows than you"}
{"text": "How I have ever loved the life removed"}
{"text": "And held in idle price to haunt assemblies"}
{"text": "Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps."}
{"text": "I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,"}
{"text": "A man of stricture and firm abstinence,"}
{"text": "My absolute power and place here in Vienna,"}
{"text": "And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;"}
{"text": "For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,"}
{"text": "And so it is received. Now, pious sir,"}
{"text": "You will demand of me why I do this?"}
{"text": "FRIAR THOMAS:"}
{"text": "Gladly, my lord."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "We have strict statutes and most biting laws."}
{"text": "The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,"}
{"text": "Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;"}
{"text": "Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,"}
{"text": "That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,"}
{"text": "Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,"}
{"text": "Only to stick it in their children's sight"}
{"text": "For terror, not to use, in time the rod"}
{"text": "Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,"}
{"text": "Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;"}
{"text": "And liberty plucks justice by the nose;"}
{"text": "The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart"}
{"text": "Goes all decorum."}
{"text": "FRIAR THOMAS:"}
{"text": "It rested in your grace"}
{"text": "To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:"}
{"text": "And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd"}
{"text": "Than in Lord Angelo."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I do fear, too dreadful:"}
{"text": "Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,"}
{"text": "'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them"}
{"text": "For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,"}
{"text": "When evil deeds have their permissive pass"}
{"text": "And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,"}
{"text": "I have on Angelo imposed the office;"}
{"text": "Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,"}
{"text": "And yet my nature never in the fight"}
{"text": "To do in slander. And to behold his sway,"}
{"text": "I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,"}
{"text": "Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,"}
{"text": "Supply me with the habit and instruct me"}
{"text": "How I may formally in person bear me"}
{"text": "Like a true friar. More reasons for this action"}
{"text": "At our more leisure shall I render you;"}
{"text": "Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;"}
{"text": "Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses"}
{"text": "That his blood flows, or that his appetite"}
{"text": "Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,"}
{"text": "If power change purpose, what our seemers be."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "And have you nuns no farther privileges?"}
{"text": "FRANCISCA:"}
{"text": "Are not these large enough?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;"}
{"text": "But rather wishing a more strict restraint"}
{"text": "Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Who's that which calls?"}
{"text": "FRANCISCA:"}
{"text": "It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,"}
{"text": "Turn you the key, and know his business of him;"}
{"text": "You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn."}
{"text": "When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men"}
{"text": "But in the presence of the prioress:"}
{"text": "Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,"}
{"text": "Or, if you show your face, you must not speak."}
{"text": "He calls again; I pray you, answer him."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses"}
{"text": "Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me"}
{"text": "As bring me to the sight of Isabella,"}
{"text": "A novice of this place and the fair sister"}
{"text": "To her unhappy brother Claudio?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,"}
{"text": "The rather for I now must make you know"}
{"text": "I am that Isabella and his sister."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:"}
{"text": "Not to be weary with you, he's in prison."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Woe me! for what?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "For that which, if myself might be his judge,"}
{"text": "He should receive his punishment in thanks:"}
{"text": "He hath got his friend with child."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Sir, make me not your story."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "It is true."}
{"text": "I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin"}
{"text": "With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,"}
{"text": "Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:"}
{"text": "I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted."}
{"text": "By your renouncement an immortal spirit,"}
{"text": "And to be talk'd with in sincerity,"}
{"text": "As with a saint."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "You do blaspheme the good in mocking me."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:"}
{"text": "Your brother and his lover have embraced:"}
{"text": "As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time"}
{"text": "That from the seedness the bare fallow brings"}
{"text": "To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb"}
{"text": "Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Is she your cousin?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names"}
{"text": "By vain though apt affection."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "She it is."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, let him marry her."}

{"text": "This is the point."}
{"text": "The duke is very strangely gone from hence;"}

{"text": "In hand and hope of action: but we do learn"}
{"text": "By those that know the very nerves of state,"}
{"text": "His givings-out were of an infinite distance"}
{"text": "From his true-meant design. Upon his place,"}
{"text": "And with full line of his authority,"}
{"text": "Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood"}
{"text": "Is very snow-broth; one who never feels"}
{"text": "The wanton stings and motions of the sense,"}
{"text": "But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge"}
{"text": "With profits of the mind, study and fast."}
{"text": "He--to give fear to use and liberty,"}
{"text": "Which have for long run by the hideous law,"}
{"text": "As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,"}
{"text": "Under whose heavy sense your brother's life"}
{"text": "Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;"}
{"text": "And follows close the rigour of the statute,"}
{"text": "To make him an example. All hope is gone,"}
{"text": "Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer"}
{"text": "To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business"}
{"text": "'Twixt you and your poor brother."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Doth he so seek his life?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Has censured him"}

{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Is there no remedy?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "None, but such remedy as, to save a head,"}
{"text": "To cleave a heart in twain."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "But is there any?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Yes, brother, you may live:"}
{"text": "There is a devilish mercy in the judge,"}
{"text": "If you'll implore it, that will free your life,"}
{"text": "But fetter you till death."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Perpetual durance?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,"}
{"text": "Though all the world's vastidity you had,"}
{"text": "To a determined scope."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "But in what nature?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "In such a one as, you consenting to't,"}
{"text": "Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,"}
{"text": "And leave you naked."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Let me know the point."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,"}
{"text": "Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,"}
{"text": "And six or seven winters more respect"}
{"text": "Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?"}
{"text": "The sense of death is most in apprehension;"}
{"text": "And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,"}
{"text": "In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great"}
{"text": "As when a giant dies."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Why give you me this shame?"}
{"text": "Think you I can a resolution fetch"}
{"text": "From flowery tenderness? If I must die,"}
{"text": "I will encounter darkness as a bride,"}
{"text": "And hug it in mine arms."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "There spake my brother; there my father's grave"}
{"text": "Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:"}
{"text": "Thou art too noble to conserve a life"}
{"text": "In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,"}
{"text": "Whose settled visage and deliberate word"}
{"text": "Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew"}
{"text": "As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil"}
{"text": "His filth within being cast, he would appear"}
{"text": "A pond as deep as hell."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "The prenzie Angelo!"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,"}
{"text": "The damned'st body to invest and cover"}
{"text": "In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?"}
{"text": "If I would yield him my virginity,"}
{"text": "Thou mightst be freed."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "O heavens! it cannot be."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,"}
{"text": "So to offend him still. This night's the time"}
{"text": "That I should do what I abhor to name,"}
{"text": "Or else thou diest to-morrow."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Thou shalt not do't."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, were it but my life,"}
{"text": "I'ld throw it down for your deliverance"}
{"text": "As frankly as a pin."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Thanks, dear Isabel."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Yes. Has he affections in him,"}
{"text": "That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,"}
{"text": "When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,"}
{"text": "Or of the deadly seven, it is the least."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Which is the least?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "If it were damnable, he being so wise,"}
{"text": "Why would he for the momentary trick"}
{"text": "Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "What says my brother?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Death is a fearful thing."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "And shamed life a hateful."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;"}
{"text": "To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;"}
{"text": "This sensible warm motion to become"}
{"text": "A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit"}
{"text": "To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside"}
{"text": "In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;"}
{"text": "To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,"}
{"text": "And blown with restless violence round about"}
{"text": "The pendent world; or to be worse than worst"}
{"text": "Of those that lawless and incertain thought"}
{"text": "Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!"}
{"text": "The weariest and most loathed worldly life"}
{"text": "That age, ache, penury and imprisonment"}
{"text": "Can lay on nature is a paradise"}
{"text": "To what we fear of death."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Alas, alas!"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Sweet sister, let me live:"}
{"text": "What sin you do to save a brother's life,"}
{"text": "Nature dispenses with the deed so far"}
{"text": "That it becomes a virtue."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O you beast!"}
{"text": "O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!"}
{"text": "Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?"}
{"text": "Is't not a kind of incest, to take life"}
{"text": "From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?"}
{"text": "Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!"}
{"text": "For such a warped slip of wilderness"}
{"text": "Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!"}
{"text": "Die, perish! Might but my bending down"}
{"text": "Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:"}
{"text": "I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,"}
{"text": "No word to save thee."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, hear me, Isabel."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, fie, fie, fie!"}
{"text": "Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade."}
{"text": "Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:"}
{"text": "'Tis best thou diest quickly."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "O hear me, Isabella!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "What is your will?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and"}
{"text": "by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I"}
{"text": "would require is likewise your own benefit."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be"}
{"text": "stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you"}
{"text": "and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to"}
{"text": "corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her"}
{"text": "virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition"}
{"text": "of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,"}
{"text": "hath made him that gracious denial which he is most"}
{"text": "glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I"}
{"text": "know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to"}
{"text": "death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes"}
{"text": "that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to"}
{"text": "your knees and make ready."}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love"}
{"text": "with life that I will sue to be rid of it."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Hold you there: farewell."}
{"text": "Provost, a word with you!"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "What's your will, father"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me"}
{"text": "awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my"}
{"text": "habit no loss shall touch her by my company."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "In good time."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:"}
{"text": "the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty"}
{"text": "brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of"}
{"text": "your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever"}
{"text": "fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,"}
{"text": "fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but"}
{"text": "that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should"}
{"text": "wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this"}
{"text": "substitute, and to save your brother?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my"}
{"text": "brother die by the law than my son should be"}
{"text": "unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke"}
{"text": "deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can"}
{"text": "speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or"}
{"text": "discover his government."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter"}
{"text": "now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made"}
{"text": "trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my"}
{"text": "advisings: to the love I have in doing good a"}
{"text": "remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe"}
{"text": "that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged"}
{"text": "lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from"}
{"text": "the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious"}
{"text": "person; and much please the absent duke, if"}
{"text": "peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of"}
{"text": "this business."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do"}
{"text": "anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have"}
{"text": "you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of"}
{"text": "Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "She should this Angelo have married; was affianced"}
{"text": "to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between"}
{"text": "which time of the contract and limit of the"}
{"text": "solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,"}
{"text": "having in that perished vessel the dowry of his"}
{"text": "sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the"}
{"text": "poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and"}
{"text": "renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most"}
{"text": "kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of"}
{"text": "her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her"}
{"text": "combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them"}
{"text": "with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,"}
{"text": "pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,"}
{"text": "bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet"}
{"text": "wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,"}
{"text": "is washed with them, but relents not."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid"}
{"text": "from the world! What corruption in this life, that"}
{"text": "it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the"}
{"text": "cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps"}
{"text": "you from dishonour in doing it."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Show me how, good father."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance"}
{"text": "of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that"}
{"text": "in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,"}
{"text": "like an impediment in the current, made it more"}
{"text": "violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his"}
{"text": "requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with"}
{"text": "his demands to the point; only refer yourself to"}
{"text": "this advantage, first, that your stay with him may"}
{"text": "not be long; that the time may have all shadow and"}
{"text": "silence in it; and the place answer to convenience."}
{"text": "This being granted in course,--and now follows"}
{"text": "all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up"}
{"text": "your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter"}
{"text": "acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to"}
{"text": "her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother"}
{"text": "saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana"}
{"text": "advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid"}
{"text": "will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you"}
{"text": "think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness"}
{"text": "of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof."}
{"text": "What think you of it?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "The image of it gives me content already; and I"}
{"text": "trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily"}
{"text": "to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his"}
{"text": "bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will"}
{"text": "presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated"}
{"text": "grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that"}
{"text": "place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that"}
{"text": "it may be quickly."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father."}
{"text": "ELBOW:"}
{"text": "Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will"}
{"text": "needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we"}

{"text": "true, think you?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "How should he be made, then?"}

{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the"}

{"text": "man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?"}
{"text": "Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a"}

{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I never heard the absent duke much detected for"}
{"text": "women; he was not inclined that way."}

{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis not possible."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and"}

{"text": "that let me inform you."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You do him wrong, surely."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the"}

{"text": "withdrawing."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What, I prithee, might be the cause?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the"}

{"text": "understand, the greater file of the subject held the"}
{"text": "duke to be wise."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Wise! why, no question but he was."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:"}
{"text": "the very stream of his life and the business he hath"}
{"text": "helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better"}
{"text": "proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own"}

{"text": "envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier."}
{"text": "Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your"}
{"text": "knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, I know him, and I love him."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}

{"text": "Come, sir, I know what I know."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I can hardly believe that, since you know not what"}
{"text": "you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our"}
{"text": "prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your"}
{"text": "answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,"}
{"text": "you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call"}
{"text": "upon you; and, I pray you, your name?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}

{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I fear you not."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you"}
{"text": "imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I"}
{"text": "can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,"}
{"text": "friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if"}
{"text": "Claudio die to-morrow or no?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Why should he die, sir?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would"}
{"text": "the duke we talk of were returned again: the"}
{"text": "ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with"}
{"text": "continency; sparrows must not build in his"}
{"text": "house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke"}
{"text": "yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would"}
{"text": "never bring them to light: would he were returned!"}
{"text": "Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing."}
{"text": "Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The"}
{"text": "duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on"}
{"text": "Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,"}
{"text": "he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown"}
{"text": "bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "No might nor greatness in mortality"}
{"text": "Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny"}
{"text": "The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong"}
{"text": "Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?"}
{"text": "But who comes here?"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Go; away with her to prison!"}
{"text": "MISTRESS OVERDONE:"}
{"text": "Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted"}
{"text": "a merciful man; good my lord."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in"}
{"text": "the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play"}
{"text": "the tyrant."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please"}
{"text": "your honour."}
{"text": "MISTRESS OVERDONE:"}
{"text": "My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me."}
{"text": "Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the"}
{"text": "duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child"}
{"text": "is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:"}
{"text": "I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be"}
{"text": "called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;"}
{"text": "no more words."}
{"text": "Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;"}
{"text": "Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished"}
{"text": "with divines, and have all charitable preparation."}
{"text": "if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be"}
{"text": "so with him."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "So please you, this friar hath been with him, and"}
{"text": "advised him for the entertainment of death."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Good even, good father."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Bliss and goodness on you!"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Of whence are you?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Not of this country, though my chance is now"}
{"text": "To use it for my time: I am a brother"}
{"text": "Of gracious order, late come from the See"}
{"text": "In special business from his holiness."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "What news abroad i' the world?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "None, but that there is so great a fever on"}
{"text": "goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:"}
{"text": "novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous"}
{"text": "to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous"}
{"text": "to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce"}
{"text": "truth enough alive to make societies secure; but"}
{"text": "security enough to make fellowships accurst: much"}
{"text": "upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This"}
{"text": "news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I"}
{"text": "pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "One that, above all other strifes, contended"}
{"text": "especially to know himself."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What pleasure was he given to?"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at"}
{"text": "any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a"}
{"text": "gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to"}
{"text": "his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;"}
{"text": "and let me desire to know how you find Claudio"}
{"text": "prepared. I am made to understand that you have"}
{"text": "lent him visitation."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "He professes to have received no sinister measure"}
{"text": "from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself"}
{"text": "to the determination of justice: yet had he framed"}
{"text": "to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many"}
{"text": "deceiving promises of life; which I by my good"}
{"text": "leisure have discredited to him, and now is he"}
{"text": "resolved to die."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "You have paid the heavens your function, and the"}
{"text": "prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have"}
{"text": "laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest"}
{"text": "shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I"}
{"text": "found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him"}
{"text": "he is indeed Justice."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "If his own life answer the straitness of his"}
{"text": "proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he"}
{"text": "chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Peace be with you!"}
{"text": "He who the sword of heaven will bear"}
{"text": "Should be as holy as severe;"}
{"text": "Pattern in himself to know,"}
{"text": "Grace to stand, and virtue go;"}
{"text": "More nor less to others paying"}
{"text": "Than by self-offences weighing."}
{"text": "Shame to him whose cruel striking"}
{"text": "Kills for faults of his own liking!"}
{"text": "Twice treble shame on Angelo,"}
{"text": "To weed my vice and let his grow!"}
{"text": "O, what may man within him hide,"}
{"text": "Though angel on the outward side!"}
{"text": "How may likeness made in crimes,"}
{"text": "Making practise on the times,"}
{"text": "To draw with idle spiders' strings"}
{"text": "Most ponderous and substantial things!"}
{"text": "Craft against vice I must apply:"}
{"text": "With Angelo to-night shall lie"}
{"text": "His old betrothed but despised;"}
{"text": "So disguise shall, by the disguised,"}
{"text": "Pay with falsehood false exacting,"}
{"text": "And perform an old contracting."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:"}
{"text": "Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice"}
{"text": "Hath often still'd my brawling discontent."}
{"text": "I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish"}
{"text": "You had not found me here so musical:"}
{"text": "Let me excuse me, and believe me so,"}
{"text": "My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm"}
{"text": "To make bad good, and good provoke to harm."}
{"text": "I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired"}
{"text": "for me here to-day? much upon this time have"}
{"text": "I promised here to meet."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "You have not been inquired after:"}
{"text": "I have sat here all day."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I do constantly believe you. The time is come even"}
{"text": "now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may"}
{"text": "be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "I am always bound to you."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Very well met, and well come."}
{"text": "What is the news from this good deputy?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "He hath a garden circummured with brick,"}
{"text": "Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;"}
{"text": "And to that vineyard is a planched gate,"}
{"text": "That makes his opening with this bigger key:"}
{"text": "This other doth command a little door"}
{"text": "Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;"}
{"text": "There have I made my promise"}
{"text": "Upon the heavy middle of the night"}
{"text": "To call upon him."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "But shall you on your knowledge find this way?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:"}
{"text": "With whispering and most guilty diligence,"}
{"text": "In action all of precept, he did show me"}
{"text": "The way twice o'er."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Are there no other tokens"}
{"text": "Between you 'greed concerning her observance?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;"}
{"text": "And that I have possess'd him my most stay"}
{"text": "Can be but brief; for I have made him know"}
{"text": "I have a servant comes with me along,"}
{"text": "That stays upon me, whose persuasion is"}
{"text": "I come about my brother."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis well borne up."}
{"text": "I have not yet made known to Mariana"}
{"text": "A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!"}
{"text": "I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;"}
{"text": "She comes to do you good."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I do desire the like."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?"}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Good friar, I know you do, and have found it."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Take, then, this your companion by the hand,"}
{"text": "Who hath a story ready for your ear."}
{"text": "I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;"}
{"text": "The vaporous night approaches."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Will't please you walk aside?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O place and greatness! millions of false eyes"}
{"text": "Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report"}
{"text": "Run with these false and most contrarious quests"}
{"text": "Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit"}
{"text": "Make thee the father of their idle dreams"}
{"text": "And rack thee in their fancies."}
{"text": "Welcome, how agreed?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,"}
{"text": "If you advise it."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It is not my consent,"}
{"text": "But my entreaty too."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Little have you to say"}
{"text": "When you depart from him, but, soft and low,"}
{"text": "'Remember now my brother.'"}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Fear me not."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all."}
{"text": "He is your husband on a pre-contract:"}
{"text": "To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,"}
{"text": "Sith that the justice of your title to him"}
{"text": "Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:"}
{"text": "Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?"}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a"}
{"text": "married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never"}
{"text": "cut off a woman's head."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a"}
{"text": "direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio"}
{"text": "and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common"}
{"text": "executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if"}
{"text": "you will take it on you to assist him, it shall"}
{"text": "redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have"}
{"text": "your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance"}
{"text": "with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a"}
{"text": "notorious bawd."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;"}
{"text": "but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I"}
{"text": "would be glad to receive some instruction from my"}
{"text": "fellow partner."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Do you call, sir?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in"}
{"text": "your execution. If you think it meet, compound with"}
{"text": "him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if"}
{"text": "not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He"}
{"text": "cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd."}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn"}
{"text": "the scale."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a"}
{"text": "good favour you have, but that you have a hanging"}
{"text": "look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir; a mystery"}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and"}
{"text": "your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,"}
{"text": "using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:"}
{"text": "but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I"}
{"text": "should be hanged, I cannot imagine."}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Sir, it is a mystery."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Proof?"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be"}
{"text": "too little for your thief, your true man thinks it"}
{"text": "big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your"}
{"text": "thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's"}
{"text": "apparel fits your thief."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Are you agreed?"}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is"}
{"text": "a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth"}
{"text": "oftener ask forgiveness."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe"}
{"text": "to-morrow four o'clock."}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have"}
{"text": "occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find"}
{"text": "me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you"}
{"text": "a good turn."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:"}
{"text": "The one has my pity; not a jot the other,"}
{"text": "Being a murderer, though he were my brother."}
{"text": "Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:"}
{"text": "'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow"}
{"text": "Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?"}
{"text": "CLAUDIO:"}
{"text": "As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour"}
{"text": "When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:"}
{"text": "He will not wake."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Who can do good on him?"}
{"text": "Well, go, prepare yourself."}
{"text": "But, hark, what noise?"}
{"text": "Heaven give your spirits comfort!"}
{"text": "By and by."}
{"text": "I hope it is some pardon or reprieve"}
{"text": "For the most gentle Claudio."}
{"text": "Welcome father."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "The best and wholesomest spirts of the night"}
{"text": "Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "None, since the curfew rung."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Not Isabel?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "No."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "They will, then, ere't be long."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "What comfort is for Claudio?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "There's some in hope."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "It is a bitter deputy."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd"}
{"text": "Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:"}
{"text": "He doth with holy abstinence subdue"}
{"text": "That in himself which he spurs on his power"}
{"text": "To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that"}
{"text": "Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;"}
{"text": "But this being so, he's just."}
{"text": "Now are they come."}
{"text": "This is a gentle provost: seldom when"}
{"text": "The steeled gaoler is the friend of men."}
{"text": "How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste"}
{"text": "That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "There he must stay until the officer"}
{"text": "Arise to let him in: he is call'd up."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,"}
{"text": "But he must die to-morrow?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "None, sir, none."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "As near the dawning, provost, as it is,"}
{"text": "You shall hear more ere morning."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Happily"}
{"text": "You something know; yet I believe there comes"}
{"text": "No countermand; no such example have we:"}
{"text": "Besides, upon the very siege of justice"}
{"text": "Lord Angelo hath to the public ear"}
{"text": "Profess'd the contrary."}
{"text": "This is his lordship's man."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And here comes Claudio's pardon."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I shall obey him."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss"}
{"text": "in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted"}
{"text": "putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Pray you, let's hear."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the"}
{"text": "afternoon?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one"}
{"text": "that is a prisoner nine years old."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "How came it that the absent duke had not either"}
{"text": "delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I"}
{"text": "have heard it was ever his manner to do so."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,"}
{"text": "indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord"}
{"text": "Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It is now apparent?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Most manifest, and not denied by himself."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how"}
{"text": "seems he to be touched?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but"}
{"text": "as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless"}
{"text": "of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of"}
{"text": "mortality, and desperately mortal."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "He wants advice."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty"}
{"text": "of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he"}
{"text": "would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days"}
{"text": "entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if"}
{"text": "to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming"}
{"text": "warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "More of him anon. There is written in your brow,"}
{"text": "provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not"}
{"text": "truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the"}
{"text": "boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard."}
{"text": "Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is"}
{"text": "no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath"}
{"text": "sentenced him. To make you understand this in a"}
{"text": "manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;"}
{"text": "for the which you are to do me both a present and a"}
{"text": "dangerous courtesy."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Pray, sir, in what?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "In the delaying death."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,"}
{"text": "and an express command, under penalty, to deliver"}
{"text": "his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case"}
{"text": "as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my"}
{"text": "instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine"}
{"text": "be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it."}
{"text": "Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was"}
{"text": "the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his"}
{"text": "death: you know the course is common. If any thing"}
{"text": "fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good"}
{"text": "fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead"}
{"text": "against it with my life."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "To him, and to his substitutes."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You will think you have made no offence, if the duke"}
{"text": "avouch the justice of your dealing?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "But what likelihood is in that?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see"}
{"text": "you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor"}
{"text": "persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go"}
{"text": "further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you."}
{"text": "Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the"}
{"text": "duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the"}
{"text": "signet is not strange to you."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I know them both."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "The contents of this is the return of the duke: you"}
{"text": "shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you"}
{"text": "shall find, within these two days he will be here."}
{"text": "This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this"}
{"text": "very day receives letters of strange tenor;"}
{"text": "perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering"}
{"text": "into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what"}
{"text": "is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the"}
{"text": "shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these"}
{"text": "things should be: all difficulties are but easy"}
{"text": "when they are known. Call your executioner, and off"}
{"text": "with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present"}
{"text": "shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you"}
{"text": "are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you."}
{"text": "Come away; it is almost clear dawn."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house"}
{"text": "of profession: one would think it were Mistress"}
{"text": "Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old"}
{"text": "customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in"}
{"text": "for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,"}
{"text": "ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made"}
{"text": "five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not"}
{"text": "much in request, for the old women were all dead."}
{"text": "Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of"}
{"text": "Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of"}
{"text": "peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a"}
{"text": "beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young"}
{"text": "Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master"}
{"text": "Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young"}
{"text": "Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master"}
{"text": "Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the"}
{"text": "great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed"}
{"text": "Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in"}
{"text": "our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged."}
{"text": "Master Barnardine!"}

{"text": "What, ho, Barnardine!"}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}

{"text": "good, sir, to rise and be put to death."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}

{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle."}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?"}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "Very ready, sir."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?"}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your"}
{"text": "prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not"}
{"text": "fitted for 't."}
{"text": "POMPEY:"}
{"text": "O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,"}
{"text": "and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the"}
{"text": "sounder all the next day."}
{"text": "ABHORSON:"}
{"text": "Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do"}
{"text": "we jest now, think you?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily"}
{"text": "you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort"}
{"text": "you and pray with you."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,"}
{"text": "and I will have more time to prepare me, or they"}
{"text": "shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not"}
{"text": "consent to die this day, that's certain."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you"}
{"text": "Look forward on the journey you shall go."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "I swear I will not die to-day for any man's"}
{"text": "persuasion."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "But hear you."}
{"text": "BARNARDINE:"}
{"text": "Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,"}
{"text": "come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!"}
{"text": "After him, fellows; bring him to the block."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;"}
{"text": "And to transport him in the mind he is"}
{"text": "Were damnable."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Here in the prison, father,"}
{"text": "There died this morning of a cruel fever"}
{"text": "One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,"}
{"text": "A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head"}
{"text": "Just of his colour. What if we do omit"}
{"text": "This reprobate till he were well inclined;"}
{"text": "And satisfy the deputy with the visage"}
{"text": "Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!"}
{"text": "Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on"}
{"text": "Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,"}
{"text": "And sent according to command; whiles I"}
{"text": "Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "This shall be done, good father, presently."}
{"text": "But Barnardine must die this afternoon:"}
{"text": "And how shall we continue Claudio,"}
{"text": "To save me from the danger that might come"}
{"text": "If he were known alive?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Let this be done."}
{"text": "Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:"}
{"text": "Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting"}
{"text": "To the under generation, you shall find"}
{"text": "Your safety manifested."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I am your free dependant."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo."}
{"text": "Now will I write letters to Angelo,--"}
{"text": "The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents"}
{"text": "Shall witness to him I am near at home,"}
{"text": "And that, by great injunctions, I am bound"}
{"text": "To enter publicly: him I'll desire"}
{"text": "To meet me at the consecrated fount"}
{"text": "A league below the city; and from thence,"}
{"text": "By cold gradation and well-balanced form,"}
{"text": "We shall proceed with Angelo."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Here is the head; I'll carry it myself."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Convenient is it. Make a swift return;"}
{"text": "For I would commune with you of such things"}
{"text": "That want no ear but yours."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "I'll make all speed."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know"}
{"text": "If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:"}
{"text": "But I will keep her ignorant of her good,"}
{"text": "To make her heavenly comforts of despair,"}
{"text": "When it is least expected."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Ho, by your leave!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "The better, given me by so holy a man."}
{"text": "Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:"}
{"text": "His head is off and sent to Angelo."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Nay, but it is not so."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,"}
{"text": "In your close patience."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You shall not be admitted to his sight."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!"}
{"text": "Injurious world! most damned Angelo!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;"}
{"text": "Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven."}
{"text": "Mark what I say, which you shall find"}
{"text": "By every syllable a faithful verity:"}
{"text": "The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;"}
{"text": "One of our convent, and his confessor,"}
{"text": "Gives me this instance: already he hath carried"}
{"text": "Notice to Escalus and Angelo,"}
{"text": "Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,"}
{"text": "There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom"}
{"text": "In that good path that I would wish it go,"}
{"text": "And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,"}
{"text": "Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,"}
{"text": "And general honour."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I am directed by you."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;"}
{"text": "'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:"}
{"text": "Say, by this token, I desire his company"}
{"text": "At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours"}
{"text": "I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you"}
{"text": "Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo"}
{"text": "Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,"}
{"text": "I am combined by a sacred vow"}
{"text": "And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:"}
{"text": "Command these fretting waters from your eyes"}
{"text": "With a light heart; trust not my holy order,"}
{"text": "If I pervert your course. Who's here?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Good even. Friar, where's the provost?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Not within, sir."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see"}
{"text": "thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain"}
{"text": "to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for"}
{"text": "my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set"}
{"text": "me to 't. But they say the duke will be here"}
{"text": "to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:"}
{"text": "if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been"}
{"text": "at home, he had lived."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your"}
{"text": "reports; but the best is, he lives not in them."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:"}
{"text": "he's a better woodman than thou takest him for."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee"}
{"text": "I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You have told me too many of him already, sir, if"}
{"text": "they be true; if not true, none were enough."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I was once before him for getting a wench with child."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Did you such a thing?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;"}
{"text": "they would else have married me to the rotten medlar."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:"}
{"text": "if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of"}
{"text": "it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions"}
{"text": "show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be"}
{"text": "not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and"}
{"text": "redeliver our authorities there"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "I guess not."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his"}
{"text": "entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,"}
{"text": "they should exhibit their petitions in the street?"}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of"}
{"text": "complaints, and to deliver us from devices"}
{"text": "hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand"}
{"text": "against us."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes"}
{"text": "i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give"}
{"text": "notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "ESCALUS:"}
{"text": "I shall, sir. Fare you well."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "Good night."}
{"text": "This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant"}
{"text": "And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!"}
{"text": "And by an eminent body that enforced"}
{"text": "The law against it! But that her tender shame"}
{"text": "Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,"}
{"text": "How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;"}
{"text": "For my authority bears of a credent bulk,"}
{"text": "That no particular scandal once can touch"}
{"text": "But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,"}
{"text": "Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,"}
{"text": "Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,"}
{"text": "By so receiving a dishonour'd life"}
{"text": "With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!"}
{"text": "A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,"}
{"text": "Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "These letters at fit time deliver me"}
{"text": "The provost knows our purpose and our plot."}
{"text": "The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,"}
{"text": "And hold you ever to our special drift;"}
{"text": "Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,"}
{"text": "As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,"}
{"text": "And tell him where I stay: give the like notice"}
{"text": "To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,"}
{"text": "And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;"}
{"text": "But send me Flavius first."}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "It shall be speeded well."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:"}
{"text": "Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends"}
{"text": "Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "To speak so indirectly I am loath:"}
{"text": "I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,"}
{"text": "That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;"}
{"text": "He says, to veil full purpose."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Be ruled by him."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure"}
{"text": "He speak against me on the adverse side,"}
{"text": "I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic"}
{"text": "That's bitter to sweet end."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "I would Friar Peter--"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, peace! the friar is come."}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,"}
{"text": "Where you may have such vantage on the duke,"}
{"text": "He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;"}
{"text": "The generous and gravest citizens"}
{"text": "Have hent the gates, and very near upon"}
{"text": "The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "My very worthy cousin, fairly met!"}
{"text": "Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "Happy return be to your royal grace!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Many and hearty thankings to you both."}
{"text": "We have made inquiry of you; and we hear"}
{"text": "Such goodness of your justice, that our soul"}
{"text": "Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,"}
{"text": "Forerunning more requital."}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "You make my bonds still greater."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,"}
{"text": "To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,"}
{"text": "When it deserves, with characters of brass,"}
{"text": "A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time"}
{"text": "And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,"}
{"text": "And let the subject see, to make them know"}
{"text": "That outward courtesies would fain proclaim"}
{"text": "Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,"}
{"text": "You must walk by us on our other hand;"}
{"text": "And good supporters are you."}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard"}
{"text": "Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!"}
{"text": "O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye"}
{"text": "By throwing it on any other object"}
{"text": "Till you have heard me in my true complaint"}
{"text": "And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief."}
{"text": "Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:"}
{"text": "Reveal yourself to him."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O worthy duke,"}
{"text": "You bid me seek redemption of the devil:"}
{"text": "Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak"}
{"text": "Must either punish me, not being believed,"}
{"text": "Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!"}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:"}
{"text": "She hath been a suitor to me for her brother"}
{"text": "Cut off by course of justice,--"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "By course of justice!"}
{"text": "ANGELO:"}
{"text": "And she will speak most bitterly and strange."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:"}
{"text": "That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?"}
{"text": "That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?"}
{"text": "That Angelo is an adulterous thief,"}
{"text": "An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;"}
{"text": "Is it not strange and strange?"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, it is ten times strange."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "It is not truer he is Angelo"}
{"text": "Than this is all as true as it is strange:"}
{"text": "Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth"}
{"text": "To the end of reckoning."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Away with her! Poor soul,"}
{"text": "She speaks this in the infirmity of sense."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest"}
{"text": "There is another comfort than this world,"}
{"text": "That thou neglect me not, with that opinion"}
{"text": "That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible"}
{"text": "That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible"}
{"text": "But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,"}
{"text": "May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute"}
{"text": "As Angelo; even so may Angelo,"}
{"text": "In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,"}
{"text": "Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:"}
{"text": "If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,"}
{"text": "Had I more name for badness."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "By mine honesty,"}
{"text": "If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--"}
{"text": "Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,"}
{"text": "Such a dependency of thing on thing,"}
{"text": "As e'er I heard in madness."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O gracious duke,"}
{"text": "Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason"}
{"text": "For inequality; but let your reason serve"}
{"text": "To make the truth appear where it seems hid,"}
{"text": "And hide the false seems true."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Many that are not mad"}
{"text": "Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I am the sister of one Claudio,"}
{"text": "Condemn'd upon the act of fornication"}
{"text": "To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:"}
{"text": "I, in probation of a sisterhood,"}
{"text": "Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio"}
{"text": "As then the messenger,--"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "That's I, an't like your grace:"}
{"text": "I came to her from Claudio, and desired her"}
{"text": "To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo"}
{"text": "For her poor brother's pardon."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "That's he indeed."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You were not bid to speak."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "No, my good lord;"}
{"text": "Nor wish'd to hold my peace."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I wish you now, then;"}
{"text": "Pray you, take note of it: and when you have"}
{"text": "A business for yourself, pray heaven you then"}
{"text": "Be perfect."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "I warrant your honour."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "The warrants for yourself; take heed to't."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "Right."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It may be right; but you are i' the wrong"}
{"text": "To speak before your time. Proceed."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "I went"}
{"text": "To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "That's somewhat madly spoken."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Pardon it;"}
{"text": "The phrase is to the matter."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Mended again. The matter; proceed."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "In brief, to set the needless process by,"}
{"text": "How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,"}
{"text": "How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--"}
{"text": "For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion"}
{"text": "I now begin with grief and shame to utter:"}
{"text": "He would not, but by gift of my chaste body"}
{"text": "To his concupiscible intemperate lust,"}
{"text": "Release my brother; and, after much debatement,"}
{"text": "My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,"}
{"text": "And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,"}
{"text": "His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant"}
{"text": "For my poor brother's head."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "This is most likely!"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "O, that it were as like as it is true!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,"}
{"text": "Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour"}
{"text": "In hateful practise. First, his integrity"}
{"text": "Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason"}
{"text": "That with such vehemency he should pursue"}
{"text": "Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,"}
{"text": "He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself"}
{"text": "And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:"}
{"text": "Confess the truth, and say by whose advice"}
{"text": "Thou camest here to complain."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "And is this all?"}
{"text": "Then, O you blessed ministers above,"}
{"text": "Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time"}
{"text": "Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up"}
{"text": "In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,"}
{"text": "As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!"}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!"}
{"text": "To prison with her! Shall we thus permit"}
{"text": "A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall"}
{"text": "On him so near us? This needs must be a practise."}
{"text": "Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?"}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;"}
{"text": "I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord"}
{"text": "For certain words he spake against your grace"}
{"text": "In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!"}
{"text": "And to set on this wretched woman here"}
{"text": "Against our substitute! Let this friar be found."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,"}
{"text": "I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,"}
{"text": "A very scurvy fellow."}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "Blessed be your royal grace!"}
{"text": "I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard"}
{"text": "Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman"}
{"text": "Most wrongfully accused your substitute,"}
{"text": "Who is as free from touch or soil with her"}
{"text": "As she from one ungot."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "We did believe no less."}
{"text": "Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?"}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "I know him for a man divine and holy;"}
{"text": "Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,"}
{"text": "As he's reported by this gentleman;"}
{"text": "And, on my trust, a man that never yet"}
{"text": "Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace."}
{"text": "LUCIO:"}
{"text": "My lord, most villanously; believe it."}
{"text": "FRIAR PETER:"}
{"text": "Well, he in time may come to clear himself;"}
{"text": "But at this instant he is sick my lord,"}
{"text": "Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,"}
{"text": "Being come to knowledge that there was complaint"}
{"text": "Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,"}
{"text": "To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know"}
{"text": "Is true and false; and what he with his oath"}
{"text": "And all probation will make up full clear,"}
{"text": "Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman."}
{"text": "To justify this worthy nobleman,"}
{"text": "So vulgarly and personally accused,"}
{"text": "Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,"}
{"text": "Till she herself confess it."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Good friar, let's hear it."}
{"text": "Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?"}
{"text": "O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!"}
{"text": "Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;"}
{"text": "In this I'll be impartial; be you judge"}
{"text": "Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?"}
{"text": "First, let her show her face, and after speak."}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}
{"text": "Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face"}
{"text": "Until my husband bid me."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What, are you married?"}
{"text": "MARIANA:"}

{"text": "Be not so hot; the duke"}

{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "He dies for Claudio's death."}
{"text": "ISABELLA:"}
{"text": "Most bounteous sir,"}
{"text": "Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,"}
{"text": "As if my brother lived: I partly think"}
{"text": "A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,"}

{"text": "Merely, my lord."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say."}

{"text": "At an unusual hour?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "It was commanded so."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Had you a special warrant for the deed?"}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "No, my good lord; it was by private message."}
{"text": "DUKE VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "For which I do discharge you of your office:"}
{"text": "Give up your keys."}
{"text": "Provost:"}
{"text": "Pardon me, noble lord:"}

{"text": "Which is that Barnardine?"}

{"text": "This, my lord."}

{"text": "What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,"}
{"text": "Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,"}
{"text": "A most delicious banquet by his bed,"}
{"text": "And brave attendants near him when he wakes,"}
{"text": "Would not the beggar then forget himself?"}
{"text": "First Huntsman:"}
{"text": "Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose."}
{"text": "Second Huntsman:"}
{"text": "It would seem strange unto him when he waked."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy."}
{"text": "Then take him up and manage well the jest:"}
{"text": "Carry him gently to my fairest chamber"}
{"text": "And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:"}
{"text": "Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters"}
{"text": "And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:"}
{"text": "Procure me music ready when he wakes,"}
{"text": "To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;"}
{"text": "And if he chance to speak, be ready straight"}
{"text": "And with a low submissive reverence"}
{"text": "Say 'What is it your honour will command?'"}
{"text": "Let one attend him with a silver basin"}
{"text": "Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,"}
{"text": "Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,"}
{"text": "And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'"}
{"text": "Some one be ready with a costly suit"}
{"text": "And ask him what apparel he will wear;"}
{"text": "Another tell him of his hounds and horse,"}
{"text": "And that his lady mourns at his disease:"}
{"text": "Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;"}
{"text": "And when he says he is, say that he dreams,"}
{"text": "For he is nothing but a mighty lord."}
{"text": "This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:"}
{"text": "It will be pastime passing excellent,"}
{"text": "If it be husbanded with modesty."}
{"text": "First Huntsman:"}
{"text": "My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,"}
{"text": "As he shall think by our true diligence"}
{"text": "He is no less than what we say he is."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Take him up gently and to bed with him;"}
{"text": "And each one to his office when he wakes."}
{"text": "Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:"}
{"text": "Belike, some noble gentleman that means,"}
{"text": "Travelling some journey, to repose him here."}
{"text": "How now! who is it?"}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "An't please your honour, players"}
{"text": "That offer service to your lordship."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Bid them come near."}
{"text": "Now, fellows, you are welcome."}
{"text": "Players:"}
{"text": "We thank your honour."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Do you intend to stay with me tonight?"}
{"text": "A Player:"}
{"text": "So please your lordship to accept our duty."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "With all my heart. This fellow I remember,"}
{"text": "Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:"}
{"text": "'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:"}
{"text": "I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part"}
{"text": "Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd."}
{"text": "A Player:"}
{"text": "I think 'twas Soto that your honour means."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent."}
{"text": "Well, you are come to me in a happy time;"}
{"text": "The rather for I have some sport in hand"}
{"text": "Wherein your cunning can assist me much."}
{"text": "There is a lord will hear you play to-night:"}
{"text": "But I am doubtful of your modesties;"}
{"text": "Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--"}
{"text": "For yet his honour never heard a play--"}
{"text": "You break into some merry passion"}
{"text": "And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,"}
{"text": "If you should smile he grows impatient."}
{"text": "A Player:"}
{"text": "Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,"}
{"text": "Were he the veriest antic in the world."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,"}
{"text": "And give them friendly welcome every one:"}
{"text": "Let them want nothing that my house affords."}
{"text": "Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,"}
{"text": "And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:"}
{"text": "That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;"}
{"text": "And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance."}
{"text": "Tell him from me, as he will win my love,"}
{"text": "He bear himself with honourable action,"}
{"text": "Such as he hath observed in noble ladies"}
{"text": "Unto their lords, by them accomplished:"}
{"text": "Such duty to the drunkard let him do"}
{"text": "With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,"}
{"text": "And say 'What is't your honour will command,"}
{"text": "Wherein your lady and your humble wife"}
{"text": "May show her duty and make known her love?'"}
{"text": "And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,"}
{"text": "And with declining head into his bosom,"}
{"text": "Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd"}
{"text": "To see her noble lord restored to health,"}
{"text": "Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him"}
{"text": "No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:"}
{"text": "And if the boy have not a woman's gift"}
{"text": "To rain a shower of commanded tears,"}
{"text": "An onion will do well for such a shift,"}
{"text": "Which in a napkin being close convey'd"}
{"text": "Shall in despite enforce a watery eye."}
{"text": "See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:"}
{"text": "Anon I'll give thee more instructions."}
{"text": "I know the boy will well usurp the grace,"}
{"text": "Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:"}
{"text": "I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,"}
{"text": "And how my men will stay themselves from laughter"}
{"text": "When they do homage to this simple peasant."}
{"text": "I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence"}
{"text": "May well abate the over-merry spleen"}
{"text": "Which otherwise would grow into extremes."}
{"text": "SLY:"}

{"text": "What raiment will your honour wear to-day?"}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor"}
{"text": "'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if"}
{"text": "you give me any conserves, give me conserves of"}
{"text": "beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I"}
{"text": "have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings"}
{"text": "than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,"}
{"text": "sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my"}
{"text": "toes look through the over-leather."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!"}
{"text": "O, that a mighty man of such descent,"}
{"text": "Of such possessions and so high esteem,"}
{"text": "Should be infused with so foul a spirit!"}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher"}
{"text": "Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a"}
{"text": "pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a"}
{"text": "bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?"}
{"text": "Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if"}
{"text": "she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence"}

{"text": "bestraught: here's--"}
{"text": "Third Servant:"}
{"text": "O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!"}
{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "O, this is it that makes your servants droop!"}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,"}
{"text": "As beaten hence by your strange lunacy."}
{"text": "O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,"}
{"text": "Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment"}
{"text": "And banish hence these abject lowly dreams."}
{"text": "Look how thy servants do attend on thee,"}
{"text": "Each in his office ready at thy beck."}
{"text": "Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,"}
{"text": "And twenty caged nightingales do sing:"}
{"text": "Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch"}
{"text": "Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed"}
{"text": "On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis."}
{"text": "Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:"}

{"text": "Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar"}
{"text": "Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?"}

{"text": "Second Servant:"}

{"text": "Even as the waving sedges play with wind."}
{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,"}
{"text": "And how she was beguiled and surprised,"}

{"text": "Third Servant:"}
{"text": "Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,"}

{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:"}

{"text": "Than any woman in this waning age."}

{"text": "I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:"}
{"text": "Upon my life, I am a lord indeed"}

{"text": "Second Servant:"}
{"text": "Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?"}
{"text": "O, how we joy to see your wit restored!"}
{"text": "O, that once more you knew but what you are!"}

{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap."}
{"text": "But did I never speak of all that time?"}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:"}
{"text": "For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,"}
{"text": "Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;"}
{"text": "And rail upon the hostess of the house;"}
{"text": "And say you would present her at the leet,"}
{"text": "Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:"}
{"text": "Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "Ay, the woman's maid of the house."}
{"text": "Third Servant:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,"}
{"text": "Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,"}
{"text": "As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece"}

{"text": "Lord:"}
{"text": "Madam."}

{"text": "In peril to incur your former malady,"}
{"text": "That I should yet absent me from your bed:"}
{"text": "I hope this reason stands for my excuse."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "Ay, it stands so that I may hardly"}
{"text": "tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into"}
{"text": "my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in"}
{"text": "despite of the flesh and the blood."}
{"text": "Messenger:"}
{"text": "Your honour's players, heating your amendment,"}
{"text": "Are come to play a pleasant comedy;"}
{"text": "For so your doctors hold it very meet,"}
{"text": "Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,"}
{"text": "And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:"}
{"text": "Therefore they thought it good you hear a play"}
{"text": "And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,"}
{"text": "Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a"}
{"text": "comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?"}
{"text": "Page:"}
{"text": "No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "What, household stuff?"}
{"text": "Page:"}
{"text": "It is a kind of history."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side"}

{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}

{"text": "By virtue specially to be achieved."}
{"text": "Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left"}

{"text": "Glad that you thus continue your resolve"}
{"text": "To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy."}
{"text": "Only, good master, while we do admire"}

{"text": "Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;"}
{"text": "Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques"}
{"text": "As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:"}

{"text": "No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:"}
{"text": "In brief, sir, study what you most affect."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise."}
{"text": "If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,"}
{"text": "We could at once put us in readiness,"}
{"text": "And take a lodging fit to entertain"}
{"text": "Such friends as time in Padua shall beget."}
{"text": "But stay a while: what company is this?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Master, some show to welcome us to town."}

{"text": "Unless you were of gentler, milder mould."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:"}
{"text": "I wis it is not half way to her heart;"}
{"text": "But if it were, doubt not her care should be"}
{"text": "To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool"}

{"text": "From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!"}

{"text": "But in the other's silence do I see"}
{"text": "Maid's mild behavior and sobriety."}

{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Gentlemen, that I may soon make good"}

{"text": "Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?"}
{"text": "Sorry am I that our good will effects"}
{"text": "Bianca's grief."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Why will you mew her up,"}
{"text": "Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,"}

{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:"}

{"text": "And for I know she taketh most delight"}
{"text": "In music, instruments and poetry,"}
{"text": "Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,"}
{"text": "Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,"}
{"text": "Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,"}
{"text": "Prefer them hither; for to cunning men"}
{"text": "I will be very kind, and liberal"}
{"text": "To mine own children in good bringing up:"}
{"text": "And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;"}
{"text": "For I have more to commune with Bianca."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,"}
{"text": "shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I"}

{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so"}
{"text": "good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not"}
{"text": "so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails"}
{"text": "together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on"}
{"text": "both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my"}
{"text": "sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit"}
{"text": "man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will"}
{"text": "wish him to her father."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray."}
{"text": "Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked"}
{"text": "parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,"}
{"text": "that we may yet again have access to our fair"}
{"text": "mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to"}
{"text": "labour and effect one thing specially."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "What's that, I pray?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "A husband! a devil."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I say, a husband."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though"}
{"text": "her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool"}
{"text": "to be married to hell?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine"}
{"text": "to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good"}
{"text": "fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,"}
{"text": "would take her with all faults, and money enough."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with"}
{"text": "this condition, to be whipped at the high cross"}
{"text": "every morning."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten"}
{"text": "apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us"}
{"text": "friends, it shall be so far forth friendly"}
{"text": "maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter"}
{"text": "to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,"}
{"text": "and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man"}
{"text": "be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring."}
{"text": "How say you, Signior Gremio?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I am agreed; and would I had given him the best"}
{"text": "horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would"}
{"text": "thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the"}
{"text": "house of her! Come on."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible"}
{"text": "That love should of a sudden take such hold?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O Tranio, till I found it to be true,"}
{"text": "I never thought it possible or likely;"}
{"text": "But see, while idly I stood looking on,"}
{"text": "I found the effect of love in idleness:"}
{"text": "And now in plainness do confess to thee,"}
{"text": "That art to me as secret and as dear"}
{"text": "As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,"}
{"text": "Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,"}
{"text": "If I achieve not this young modest girl."}
{"text": "Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;"}
{"text": "Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Master, it is no time to chide you now;"}
{"text": "Affection is not rated from the heart:"}
{"text": "If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,"}
{"text": "'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:"}
{"text": "The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,"}
{"text": "Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,"}
{"text": "Such as the daughter of Agenor had,"}
{"text": "That made great Jove to humble him to her hand."}
{"text": "When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister"}
{"text": "Began to scold and raise up such a storm"}
{"text": "That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move"}
{"text": "And with her breath she did perfume the air:"}
{"text": "Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance."}
{"text": "I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,"}
{"text": "Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:"}
{"text": "Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd"}
{"text": "That till the father rid his hands of her,"}
{"text": "Master, your love must live a maid at home;"}
{"text": "And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,"}
{"text": "Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!"}
{"text": "But art thou not advised, he took some care"}
{"text": "To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I have it, Tranio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Master, for my hand,"}
{"text": "Both our inventions meet and jump in one."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Tell me thine first."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "You will be schoolmaster"}
{"text": "And undertake the teaching of the maid:"}
{"text": "That's your device."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "It is: may it be done?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Not possible; for who shall bear your part,"}
{"text": "And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,"}
{"text": "Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,"}
{"text": "Visit his countrymen and banquet them?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Basta; content thee, for I have it full."}
{"text": "We have not yet been seen in any house,"}
{"text": "Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces"}
{"text": "For man or master; then it follows thus;"}
{"text": "Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,"}
{"text": "Keep house and port and servants as I should:"}
{"text": "I will some other be, some Florentine,"}
{"text": "Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa."}
{"text": "'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once"}
{"text": "Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:"}
{"text": "When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;"}
{"text": "But I will charm him first to keep his tongue."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "So had you need."}
{"text": "In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,"}
{"text": "And I am tied to be obedient;"}
{"text": "For so your father charged me at our parting,"}
{"text": "'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,"}
{"text": "Although I think 'twas in another sense;"}
{"text": "I am content to be Lucentio,"}
{"text": "Because so well I love Lucentio."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:"}
{"text": "And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid"}
{"text": "Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye."}
{"text": "Here comes the rogue."}
{"text": "Sirrah, where have you been?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?"}
{"text": "Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or"}
{"text": "you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,"}
{"text": "And therefore frame your manners to the time."}
{"text": "Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,"}
{"text": "Puts my apparel and my countenance on,"}
{"text": "And I for my escape have put on his;"}
{"text": "For in a quarrel since I came ashore"}
{"text": "I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:"}
{"text": "Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,"}
{"text": "While I make way from hence to save my life:"}
{"text": "You understand me?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I, sir! ne'er a whit."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:"}
{"text": "Tranio is changed into Lucentio."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "The better for him: would I were so too!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,"}
{"text": "That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter."}
{"text": "But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise"}
{"text": "You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:"}
{"text": "When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;"}
{"text": "But in all places else your master Lucentio."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that"}
{"text": "thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if"}
{"text": "thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good"}
{"text": "and weighty."}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:"}
{"text": "comes there any more of it?"}
{"text": "Page:"}
{"text": "My lord, 'tis but begun."}
{"text": "SLY:"}
{"text": "'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:"}
{"text": "would 'twere done!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Verona, for a while I take my leave,"}
{"text": "To see my friends in Padua, but of all"}
{"text": "My best beloved and approved friend,"}
{"text": "Hortensio; and I trow this is his house."}
{"text": "Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has"}
{"text": "rebused your worship?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Villain, I say, knock me here soundly."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that"}
{"text": "I should knock you here, sir?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Villain, I say, knock me at this gate"}
{"text": "And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock"}
{"text": "you first,"}
{"text": "And then I know after who comes by the worst."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Will it not be?"}
{"text": "Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;"}
{"text": "I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Help, masters, help! my master is mad."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!"}
{"text": "and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?"}
{"text": "'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor"}
{"text": "mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound"}
{"text": "this quarrel."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin."}
{"text": "if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his"}
{"text": "service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap"}
{"text": "him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to"}
{"text": "use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,"}
{"text": "two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had"}
{"text": "well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,"}
{"text": "I bade the rascal knock upon your gate"}
{"text": "And could not get him for my heart to do it."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these"}
{"text": "words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,"}
{"text": "knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you"}
{"text": "now with, 'knocking at the gate'?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:"}
{"text": "Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,"}
{"text": "Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio."}
{"text": "And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale"}
{"text": "Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Such wind as scatters young men through the world,"}
{"text": "To seek their fortunes farther than at home"}
{"text": "Where small experience grows. But in a few,"}
{"text": "Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:"}
{"text": "Antonio, my father, is deceased;"}
{"text": "And I have thrust myself into this maze,"}
{"text": "Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:"}
{"text": "Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,"}
{"text": "And so am come abroad to see the world."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee"}
{"text": "And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?"}
{"text": "Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:"}
{"text": "And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich"}
{"text": "And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,"}
{"text": "And I'll not wish thee to her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we"}
{"text": "Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know"}
{"text": "One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,"}
{"text": "As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,"}
{"text": "Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,"}
{"text": "As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd"}
{"text": "As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,"}
{"text": "She moves me not, or not removes, at least,"}
{"text": "Affection's edge in me, were she as rough"}
{"text": "As are the swelling Adriatic seas:"}
{"text": "I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;"}
{"text": "If wealthily, then happily in Padua."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his"}
{"text": "mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to"}
{"text": "a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er"}
{"text": "a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases"}
{"text": "as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,"}
{"text": "so money comes withal."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,"}
{"text": "I will continue that I broach'd in jest."}
{"text": "I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife"}
{"text": "With wealth enough and young and beauteous,"}
{"text": "Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:"}
{"text": "Her only fault, and that is faults enough,"}
{"text": "Is that she is intolerable curst"}
{"text": "And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure"}
{"text": "That, were my state far worser than it is,"}
{"text": "I would not wed her for a mine of gold."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:"}
{"text": "Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;"}
{"text": "For I will board her, though she chide as loud"}
{"text": "As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Her father is Baptista Minola,"}
{"text": "An affable and courteous gentleman:"}
{"text": "Her name is Katharina Minola,"}
{"text": "Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I know her father, though I know not her;"}
{"text": "And he knew my deceased father well."}
{"text": "I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;"}
{"text": "And therefore let me be thus bold with you"}
{"text": "To give you over at this first encounter,"}
{"text": "Unless you will accompany me thither."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts."}
{"text": "O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she"}
{"text": "would think scolding would do little good upon him:"}
{"text": "she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:"}
{"text": "why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in"}
{"text": "his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she"}
{"text": "stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in"}
{"text": "her face and so disfigure her with it that she"}
{"text": "shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat."}
{"text": "You know him not, sir."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,"}
{"text": "For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:"}
{"text": "He hath the jewel of my life in hold,"}
{"text": "His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,"}
{"text": "And her withholds from me and other more,"}
{"text": "Suitors to her and rivals in my love,"}
{"text": "Supposing it a thing impossible,"}
{"text": "For those defects I have before rehearsed,"}
{"text": "That ever Katharina will be woo'd;"}
{"text": "Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,"}
{"text": "That none shall have access unto Bianca"}
{"text": "Till Katharina the curst have got a husband."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Katharina the curst!"}
{"text": "A title for a maid of all titles the worst."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,"}
{"text": "And offer me disguised in sober robes"}
{"text": "To old Baptista as a schoolmaster"}
{"text": "Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;"}
{"text": "That so I may, by this device, at least"}
{"text": "Have leave and leisure to make love to her"}
{"text": "And unsuspected court her by herself."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,"}
{"text": "how the young folks lay their heads together!"}
{"text": "Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love."}
{"text": "Petruchio, stand by a while."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "A proper stripling and an amorous!"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "O, very well; I have perused the note."}
{"text": "Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:"}
{"text": "All books of love, see that at any hand;"}
{"text": "And see you read no other lectures to her:"}
{"text": "You understand me: over and beside"}
{"text": "Signior Baptista's liberality,"}
{"text": "I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,"}
{"text": "And let me have them very well perfumed"}
{"text": "For she is sweeter than perfume itself"}
{"text": "To whom they go to. What will you read to her?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you"}
{"text": "As for my patron, stand you so assured,"}
{"text": "As firmly as yourself were still in place:"}
{"text": "Yea, and perhaps with more successful words"}
{"text": "Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "O this learning, what a thing it is!"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "O this woodcock, what an ass it is!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Peace, sirrah!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "And you are well met, Signior Hortensio."}
{"text": "Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola."}
{"text": "I promised to inquire carefully"}
{"text": "About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:"}
{"text": "And by good fortune I have lighted well"}
{"text": "On this young man, for learning and behavior"}
{"text": "Fit for her turn, well read in poetry"}
{"text": "And other books, good ones, I warrant ye."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman"}
{"text": "Hath promised me to help me to another,"}
{"text": "A fine musician to instruct our mistress;"}
{"text": "So shall I no whit be behind in duty"}
{"text": "To fair Bianca, so beloved of me."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "And that his bags shall prove."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:"}
{"text": "Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,"}
{"text": "I'll tell you news indifferent good for either."}
{"text": "Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,"}
{"text": "Upon agreement from us to his liking,"}
{"text": "Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,"}
{"text": "Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "So said, so done, is well."}
{"text": "Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I know she is an irksome brawling scold:"}
{"text": "If that be all, masters, I hear no harm."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:"}
{"text": "My father dead, my fortune lives for me;"}
{"text": "And I do hope good days and long to see."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!"}
{"text": "But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:"}
{"text": "You shall have me assisting you in all."}
{"text": "But will you woo this wild-cat?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Will I live?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why came I hither but to that intent?"}
{"text": "Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?"}
{"text": "Have I not in my time heard lions roar?"}
{"text": "Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds"}
{"text": "Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?"}
{"text": "Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,"}
{"text": "And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?"}
{"text": "Have I not in a pitched battle heard"}
{"text": "Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?"}
{"text": "And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,"}
{"text": "That gives not half so great a blow to hear"}
{"text": "As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?"}
{"text": "Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "For he fears none."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Hortensio, hark:"}
{"text": "This gentleman is happily arrived,"}
{"text": "My mind presumes, for his own good and ours."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I promised we would be contributors"}
{"text": "And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "And so we will, provided that he win her."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I would I were as sure of a good dinner."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,"}
{"text": "Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way"}
{"text": "To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Even he, Biondello."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Well begun, Tranio."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, a word ere you go;"}
{"text": "Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And if I be, sir, is it any offence?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "No; if without more words you will get you hence."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free"}
{"text": "For me as for you?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "But so is not she."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "For what reason, I beseech you?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "For this reason, if you'll know,"}
{"text": "That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,"}
{"text": "Do me this right; hear me with patience."}
{"text": "Baptista is a noble gentleman,"}
{"text": "To whom my father is not all unknown;"}
{"text": "And were his daughter fairer than she is,"}
{"text": "She may more suitors have and me for one."}
{"text": "Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;"}
{"text": "Then well one more may fair Bianca have:"}
{"text": "And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,"}
{"text": "Though Paris came in hope to speed alone."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "What! this gentleman will out-talk us all."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Hortensio, to what end are all these words?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,"}
{"text": "Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,"}
{"text": "The one as famous for a scolding tongue"}
{"text": "As is the other for beauteous modesty."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;"}
{"text": "And let it be more than Alcides' twelve."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:"}
{"text": "The youngest daughter whom you hearken for"}
{"text": "Her father keeps from all access of suitors,"}
{"text": "And will not promise her to any man"}
{"text": "Until the elder sister first be wed:"}
{"text": "The younger then is free and not before."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "If it be so, sir, that you are the man"}
{"text": "Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,"}
{"text": "And if you break the ice and do this feat,"}
{"text": "Achieve the elder, set the younger free"}
{"text": "For our access, whose hap shall be to have her"}
{"text": "Will not so graceless be to be ingrate."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;"}
{"text": "And since you do profess to be a suitor,"}
{"text": "You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,"}
{"text": "To whom we all rest generally beholding."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,"}
{"text": "Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,"}
{"text": "And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,"}
{"text": "And do as adversaries do in law,"}
{"text": "Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "The motion's good indeed and be it so,"}
{"text": "Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,"}
{"text": "To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;"}
{"text": "That I disdain: but for these other gawds,"}
{"text": "Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,"}
{"text": "Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;"}
{"text": "Or what you will command me will I do,"}
{"text": "So well I know my duty to my elders."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell"}
{"text": "Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Believe me, sister, of all the men alive"}
{"text": "I never yet beheld that special face"}
{"text": "Which I could fancy more than any other."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "If you affect him, sister, here I swear"}
{"text": "I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have"}
{"text": "him."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "O then, belike, you fancy riches more:"}
{"text": "You will have Gremio to keep you fair."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Is it for him you do envy me so?"}
{"text": "Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive"}
{"text": "You have but jested with me all this while:"}
{"text": "I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "If that be jest, then all the rest was so."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?"}
{"text": "Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps."}
{"text": "Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her."}
{"text": "For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,"}
{"text": "Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?"}
{"text": "When did she cross thee with a bitter word?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see"}
{"text": "She is your treasure, she must have a husband;"}
{"text": "I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day"}
{"text": "And for your love to her lead apes in hell."}
{"text": "Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep"}
{"text": "Till I can find occasion of revenge."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?"}
{"text": "But who comes here?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Good morrow, neighbour Baptista."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Good morrow, neighbour Gremio."}
{"text": "God save you, gentlemen!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter"}
{"text": "Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "You are too blunt: go to it orderly."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave."}
{"text": "I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,"}
{"text": "That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,"}
{"text": "Her affability and bashful modesty,"}
{"text": "Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,"}
{"text": "Am bold to show myself a forward guest"}
{"text": "Within your house, to make mine eye the witness"}
{"text": "Of that report which I so oft have heard."}
{"text": "And, for an entrance to my entertainment,"}
{"text": "I do present you with a man of mine,"}
{"text": "Cunning in music and the mathematics,"}
{"text": "To instruct her fully in those sciences,"}
{"text": "Whereof I know she is not ignorant:"}
{"text": "Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:"}
{"text": "His name is Licio, born in Mantua."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake."}
{"text": "But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,"}
{"text": "She is not for your turn, the more my grief."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I see you do not mean to part with her,"}
{"text": "Or else you like not of my company."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Mistake me not; I speak but as I find."}
{"text": "Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,"}
{"text": "A man well known throughout all Italy."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I know him well: you are welcome for his sake."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,"}
{"text": "Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:"}
{"text": "Baccare! you are marvellous forward."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your"}
{"text": "wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am"}
{"text": "sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,"}
{"text": "that have been more kindly beholding to you than"}
{"text": "any, freely give unto you this young scholar,"}
{"text": "that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning"}
{"text": "in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other"}
{"text": "in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,"}
{"text": "accept his service."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio."}
{"text": "Welcome, good Cambio."}
{"text": "But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:"}
{"text": "may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,"}
{"text": "That, being a stranger in this city here,"}
{"text": "Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,"}
{"text": "Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous."}
{"text": "Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,"}
{"text": "In the preferment of the eldest sister."}
{"text": "This liberty is all that I request,"}
{"text": "That, upon knowledge of my parentage,"}
{"text": "I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo"}
{"text": "And free access and favour as the rest:"}
{"text": "And, toward the education of your daughters,"}
{"text": "I here bestow a simple instrument,"}
{"text": "And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:"}
{"text": "If you accept them, then their worth is great."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "A mighty man of Pisa; by report"}
{"text": "I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,"}
{"text": "Take you the lute, and you the set of books;"}
{"text": "You shall go see your pupils presently."}
{"text": "Holla, within!"}
{"text": "Sirrah, lead these gentlemen"}
{"text": "To my daughters; and tell them both,"}
{"text": "These are their tutors: bid them use them well."}
{"text": "We will go walk a little in the orchard,"}
{"text": "And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,"}
{"text": "And so I pray you all to think yourselves."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,"}
{"text": "And every day I cannot come to woo."}
{"text": "You knew my father well, and in him me,"}
{"text": "Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,"}
{"text": "Which I have better'd rather than decreased:"}
{"text": "Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,"}
{"text": "What dowry shall I have with her to wife?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "After my death the one half of my lands,"}
{"text": "And in possession twenty thousand crowns."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of"}
{"text": "Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,"}
{"text": "In all my lands and leases whatsoever:"}
{"text": "Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,"}
{"text": "That covenants may be kept on either hand."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,"}
{"text": "That is, her love; for that is all in all."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,"}
{"text": "I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;"}
{"text": "And where two raging fires meet together"}
{"text": "They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:"}
{"text": "Though little fire grows great with little wind,"}
{"text": "Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:"}
{"text": "So I to her and so she yields to me;"}
{"text": "For I am rough and woo not like a babe."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!"}
{"text": "But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,"}
{"text": "That shake not, though they blow perpetually."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "For fear, I promise you, if I look pale."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "What, will my daughter prove a good musician?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I think she'll sooner prove a soldier"}
{"text": "Iron may hold with her, but never lutes."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me."}
{"text": "I did but tell her she mistook her frets,"}
{"text": "And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;"}
{"text": "When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,"}
{"text": "'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume"}
{"text": "with them:'"}
{"text": "And, with that word, she struck me on the head,"}
{"text": "And through the instrument my pate made way;"}
{"text": "And there I stood amazed for a while,"}
{"text": "As on a pillory, looking through the lute;"}
{"text": "While she did call me rascal fiddler"}
{"text": "And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,"}
{"text": "As had she studied to misuse me so."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;"}
{"text": "I love her ten times more than e'er I did:"}
{"text": "O, how I long to have some chat with her!"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:"}
{"text": "Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;"}
{"text": "She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns."}
{"text": "Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,"}
{"text": "Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I pray you do."}
{"text": "I will attend her here,"}
{"text": "And woo her with some spirit when she comes."}
{"text": "Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain"}
{"text": "She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:"}
{"text": "Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear"}
{"text": "As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:"}
{"text": "Say she be mute and will not speak a word;"}
{"text": "Then I'll commend her volubility,"}
{"text": "And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:"}
{"text": "If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,"}
{"text": "As though she bid me stay by her a week:"}
{"text": "If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day"}
{"text": "When I shall ask the banns and when be married."}
{"text": "But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak."}
{"text": "Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:"}
{"text": "They call me Katharina that do talk of me."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,"}
{"text": "And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;"}
{"text": "But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom"}
{"text": "Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,"}
{"text": "For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,"}
{"text": "Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;"}
{"text": "Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,"}
{"text": "Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,"}
{"text": "Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,"}
{"text": "Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither"}
{"text": "Remove you hence: I knew you at the first"}
{"text": "You were a moveable."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, what's a moveable?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "A join'd-stool."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Asses are made to bear, and so are you."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Women are made to bear, and so are you."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "No such jade as you, if me you mean."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;"}
{"text": "For, knowing thee to be but young and light--"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Too light for such a swain as you to catch;"}
{"text": "And yet as heavy as my weight should be."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Should be! should--buzz!"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Well ta'en, and like a buzzard."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "If I be waspish, best beware my sting."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "My remedy is then, to pluck it out."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Who knows not where a wasp does"}
{"text": "wear his sting? In his tail."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "In his tongue."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Whose tongue?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,"}
{"text": "Good Kate; I am a gentleman."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "That I'll try."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "So may you lose your arms:"}
{"text": "If you strike me, you are no gentleman;"}
{"text": "And if no gentleman, why then no arms."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "What is your crest? a coxcomb?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "It is my fashion, when I see a crab."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "There is, there is."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Then show it me."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Had I a glass, I would."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "What, you mean my face?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Well aim'd of such a young one."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Yet you are wither'd."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis with cares."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I care not."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle."}
{"text": "'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,"}
{"text": "And now I find report a very liar;"}
{"text": "For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,"}
{"text": "But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:"}
{"text": "Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,"}
{"text": "Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,"}
{"text": "Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,"}
{"text": "But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,"}
{"text": "With gentle conference, soft and affable."}
{"text": "Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?"}
{"text": "O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig"}
{"text": "Is straight and slender and as brown in hue"}
{"text": "As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels."}
{"text": "O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Did ever Dian so become a grove"}
{"text": "As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?"}
{"text": "O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;"}
{"text": "And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Where did you study all this goodly speech?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "It is extempore, from my mother-wit."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "A witty mother! witless else her son."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Am I not wise?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Yes; keep you warm."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:"}
{"text": "And therefore, setting all this chat aside,"}
{"text": "Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented"}
{"text": "That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;"}
{"text": "And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you."}
{"text": "Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;"}
{"text": "For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,"}
{"text": "Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,"}
{"text": "Thou must be married to no man but me;"}
{"text": "For I am he am born to tame you Kate,"}
{"text": "And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate"}
{"text": "Conformable as other household Kates."}
{"text": "Here comes your father: never make denial;"}
{"text": "I must and will have Katharina to my wife."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "How but well, sir? how but well?"}
{"text": "It were impossible I should speed amiss."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Call you me daughter? now, I promise you"}
{"text": "You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,"}
{"text": "To wish me wed to one half lunatic;"}
{"text": "A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,"}
{"text": "That thinks with oaths to face the matter out."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,"}
{"text": "That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:"}
{"text": "If she be curst, it is for policy,"}
{"text": "For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;"}
{"text": "She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;"}
{"text": "For patience she will prove a second Grissel,"}
{"text": "And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:"}
{"text": "And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,"}
{"text": "That upon Sunday is the wedding-day."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee"}
{"text": "hang'd first."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:"}
{"text": "If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?"}
{"text": "'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,"}
{"text": "That she shall still be curst in company."}
{"text": "I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe"}
{"text": "How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!"}
{"text": "She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss"}
{"text": "She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,"}
{"text": "That in a twink she won me to her love."}
{"text": "O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,"}
{"text": "How tame, when men and women are alone,"}
{"text": "A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew."}
{"text": "Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,"}
{"text": "To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day."}
{"text": "Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;"}
{"text": "I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I know not what to say: but give me your hands;"}
{"text": "God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Amen, say we: we will be witnesses."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;"}
{"text": "I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:"}
{"text": "We will have rings and things and fine array;"}
{"text": "And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,"}
{"text": "And venture madly on a desperate mart."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:"}
{"text": "'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "The gain I seek is, quiet in the match."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch."}
{"text": "But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:"}
{"text": "Now is the day we long have looked for:"}
{"text": "I am your neighbour, and was suitor first."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And I am one that love Bianca more"}
{"text": "Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Graybeard, thy love doth freeze."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "But thine doth fry."}
{"text": "Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:"}
{"text": "'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both"}
{"text": "That can assure my daughter greatest dower"}
{"text": "Shall have my Bianca's love."}
{"text": "Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "First, as you know, my house within the city"}
{"text": "Is richly furnished with plate and gold;"}
{"text": "Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;"}
{"text": "My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;"}
{"text": "In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;"}
{"text": "In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,"}
{"text": "Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,"}
{"text": "Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,"}
{"text": "Valance of Venice gold in needlework,"}
{"text": "Pewter and brass and all things that belong"}
{"text": "To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm"}
{"text": "I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,"}
{"text": "Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,"}
{"text": "And all things answerable to this portion."}
{"text": "Myself am struck in years, I must confess;"}
{"text": "And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,"}
{"text": "If whilst I live she will be only mine."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:"}
{"text": "I am my father's heir and only son:"}
{"text": "If I may have your daughter to my wife,"}
{"text": "I'll leave her houses three or four as good,"}
{"text": "Within rich Pisa walls, as any one"}
{"text": "Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;"}
{"text": "Besides two thousand ducats by the year"}
{"text": "Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure."}
{"text": "What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Two thousand ducats by the year of land!"}
{"text": "My land amounts not to so much in all:"}
{"text": "That she shall have; besides an argosy"}
{"text": "That now is lying in Marseilles' road."}
{"text": "What, have I choked you with an argosy?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less"}
{"text": "Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,"}
{"text": "And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,"}
{"text": "And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;"}
{"text": "And she can have no more than all I have:"}
{"text": "If you like me, she shall have me and mine."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,"}
{"text": "By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I must confess your offer is the best;"}
{"text": "And, let your father make her the assurance,"}
{"text": "She is your own; else, you must pardon me,"}
{"text": "if you should die before him, where's her dower?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "That's but a cavil: he is old, I young."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "And may not young men die, as well as old?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Well, gentlemen,"}
{"text": "I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know"}
{"text": "My daughter Katharina is to be married:"}
{"text": "Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca"}
{"text": "Be bride to you, if you this assurance;"}
{"text": "If not, Signior Gremio:"}
{"text": "And so, I take my leave, and thank you both."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Adieu, good neighbour."}
{"text": "Now I fear thee not:"}
{"text": "Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool"}
{"text": "To give thee all, and in his waning age"}
{"text": "Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!"}
{"text": "An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!"}
{"text": "Yet I have faced it with a card of ten."}
{"text": "'Tis in my head to do my master good:"}
{"text": "I see no reason but supposed Lucentio"}
{"text": "Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'"}
{"text": "And that's a wonder: fathers commonly"}
{"text": "Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,"}
{"text": "A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:"}
{"text": "Have you so soon forgot the entertainment"}
{"text": "Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "But, wrangling pedant, this is"}
{"text": "The patroness of heavenly harmony:"}
{"text": "Then give me leave to have prerogative;"}
{"text": "And when in music we have spent an hour,"}
{"text": "Your lecture shall have leisure for as much."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Preposterous ass, that never read so far"}
{"text": "To know the cause why music was ordain'd!"}
{"text": "Was it not to refresh the mind of man"}
{"text": "After his studies or his usual pain?"}
{"text": "Then give me leave to read philosophy,"}
{"text": "And while I pause, serve in your harmony."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,"}
{"text": "To strive for that which resteth in my choice:"}
{"text": "I am no breeching scholar in the schools;"}
{"text": "I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,"}
{"text": "But learn my lessons as I please myself."}
{"text": "And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:"}
{"text": "Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;"}
{"text": "His lecture will be done ere you have tuned."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "That will be never: tune your instrument."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Where left we last?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Here, madam:"}
{"text": "'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;"}
{"text": "Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Construe them."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am"}
{"text": "Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,"}
{"text": "'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;"}
{"text": "'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes"}
{"text": "a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'"}
{"text": "bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might"}
{"text": "beguile the old pantaloon."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Madam, my instrument's in tune."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Spit in the hole, man, and tune again."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat"}
{"text": "Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I"}
{"text": "trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed"}
{"text": "he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'"}
{"text": "despair not."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Madam, 'tis now in tune."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "All but the base."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars."}
{"text": "How fiery and forward our pedant is!"}
{"text": "Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:"}
{"text": "Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "In time I may believe, yet I mistrust."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides"}
{"text": "Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "I must believe my master; else, I promise you,"}
{"text": "I should be arguing still upon that doubt:"}
{"text": "But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:"}
{"text": "Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,"}
{"text": "That I have been thus pleasant with you both."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "You may go walk, and give me leave a while:"}
{"text": "My lessons make no music in three parts."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,"}
{"text": "And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,"}
{"text": "Our fine musician groweth amorous."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Madam, before you touch the instrument,"}
{"text": "To learn the order of my fingering,"}
{"text": "I must begin with rudiments of art;"}
{"text": "To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,"}
{"text": "More pleasant, pithy and effectual,"}
{"text": "Than hath been taught by any of my trade:"}
{"text": "And there it is in writing, fairly drawn."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Why, I am past my gamut long ago."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Yet read the gamut of Hortensio."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Servant:"}
{"text": "Mistress, your father prays you leave your books"}
{"text": "And help to dress your sister's chamber up:"}

{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "But I have cause to pry into this pedant:"}
{"text": "Methinks he looks as though he were in love:"}
{"text": "Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble"}
{"text": "To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,"}
{"text": "Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,"}
{"text": "Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced"}
{"text": "To give my hand opposed against my heart"}
{"text": "Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;"}
{"text": "Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure."}
{"text": "I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,"}
{"text": "Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:"}
{"text": "And, to be noted for a merry man,"}
{"text": "He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,"}
{"text": "Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;"}
{"text": "Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd."}
{"text": "Now must the world point at poor Katharina,"}

{"text": "Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too."}
{"text": "Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,"}

{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Master, master! news, old news, and such news as"}
{"text": "you never heard of!"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Is it new and old too? how may that be?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Is he come?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Why, no, sir."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "What then?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "He is coming."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "When will he be here?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "When he stands where I am and sees you there."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "But say, what to thine old news?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old"}
{"text": "jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair"}
{"text": "of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,"}
{"text": "another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the"}
{"text": "town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;"}
{"text": "with two broken points: his horse hipped with an"}
{"text": "old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;"}
{"text": "besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose"}
{"text": "in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected"}
{"text": "with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with"}
{"text": "spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,"}
{"text": "stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the"}
{"text": "bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;"}
{"text": "near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit"}
{"text": "and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being"}
{"text": "restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been"}
{"text": "often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth"}
{"text": "six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,"}
{"text": "which hath two letters for her name fairly set down"}
{"text": "in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Who comes with him?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned"}
{"text": "like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a"}
{"text": "kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red"}
{"text": "and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty"}
{"text": "fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a"}
{"text": "very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian"}
{"text": "footboy or a gentleman's lackey."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;"}
{"text": "Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, he comes not."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Didst thou not say he comes?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Who? that Petruchio came?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Ay, that Petruchio came."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, that's all one."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Nay, by Saint Jamy,"}
{"text": "I hold you a penny,"}
{"text": "A horse and a man"}
{"text": "Is more than one,"}
{"text": "And yet not many."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "You are welcome, sir."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "And yet I come not well."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "And yet you halt not."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Not so well apparell'd"}
{"text": "As I wish you were."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Were it better, I should rush in thus."}
{"text": "But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?"}
{"text": "How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:"}
{"text": "And wherefore gaze this goodly company,"}
{"text": "As if they saw some wondrous monument,"}
{"text": "Some comet or unusual prodigy?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:"}
{"text": "First were we sad, fearing you would not come;"}
{"text": "Now sadder, that you come so unprovided."}
{"text": "Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,"}
{"text": "An eye-sore to our solemn festival!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And tells us, what occasion of import"}
{"text": "Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,"}
{"text": "And sent you hither so unlike yourself?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:"}
{"text": "Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,"}
{"text": "Though in some part enforced to digress;"}
{"text": "Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse"}
{"text": "As you shall well be satisfied withal."}
{"text": "But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:"}
{"text": "The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "See not your bride in these unreverent robes:"}
{"text": "Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "But thus, I trust, you will not marry her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:"}
{"text": "To me she's married, not unto my clothes:"}
{"text": "Could I repair what she will wear in me,"}
{"text": "As I can change these poor accoutrements,"}
{"text": "'Twere well for Kate and better for myself."}
{"text": "But what a fool am I to chat with you,"}
{"text": "When I should bid good morrow to my bride,"}
{"text": "And seal the title with a lovely kiss!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "He hath some meaning in his mad attire:"}
{"text": "We will persuade him, be it possible,"}
{"text": "To put on better ere he go to church."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I'll after him, and see the event of this."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "But to her love concerneth us to add"}
{"text": "Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,"}
{"text": "As I before unparted to your worship,"}
{"text": "I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,"}
{"text": "It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--"}
{"text": "And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;"}
{"text": "And make assurance here in Padua"}
{"text": "Of greater sums than I have promised."}
{"text": "So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,"}
{"text": "And marry sweet Bianca with consent."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Were it not that my fellow-school-master"}
{"text": "Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,"}
{"text": "'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;"}
{"text": "Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,"}
{"text": "I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "That by degrees we mean to look into,"}
{"text": "And watch our vantage in this business:"}
{"text": "We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,"}
{"text": "The narrow-prying father, Minola,"}
{"text": "The quaint musician, amorous Licio;"}
{"text": "All for my master's sake, Lucentio."}
{"text": "Signior Gremio, came you from the church?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "As willingly as e'er I came from school."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,"}
{"text": "A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!"}
{"text": "I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest"}
{"text": "Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,"}
{"text": "'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,"}
{"text": "That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;"}
{"text": "And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,"}
{"text": "The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff"}
{"text": "That down fell priest and book and book and priest:"}
{"text": "'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "What said the wench when he rose again?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,"}
{"text": "As if the vicar meant to cozen him."}
{"text": "But after many ceremonies done,"}
{"text": "He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if"}
{"text": "He had been aboard, carousing to his mates"}
{"text": "After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel"}
{"text": "And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;"}
{"text": "Having no other reason"}
{"text": "But that his beard grew thin and hungerly"}
{"text": "And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking."}
{"text": "This done, he took the bride about the neck"}
{"text": "And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack"}
{"text": "That at the parting all the church did echo:"}
{"text": "And I seeing this came thence for very shame;"}
{"text": "And after me, I know, the rout is coming."}
{"text": "Such a mad marriage never was before:"}
{"text": "Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:"}
{"text": "I know you think to dine with me to-day,"}
{"text": "And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;"}
{"text": "But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,"}
{"text": "And therefore here I mean to take my leave."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Is't possible you will away to-night?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I must away to-day, before night come:"}
{"text": "Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,"}
{"text": "You would entreat me rather go than stay."}
{"text": "And, honest company, I thank you all,"}
{"text": "That have beheld me give away myself"}
{"text": "To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:"}
{"text": "Dine with my father, drink a health to me;"}
{"text": "For I must hence; and farewell to you all."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Let us entreat you stay till after dinner."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "It may not be."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Let me entreat you."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "It cannot be."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Let me entreat you."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I am content."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Are you content to stay?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I am content you shall entreat me stay;"}
{"text": "But yet not stay, entreat me how you can."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Now, if you love me, stay."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Grumio, my horse."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Nay, then,"}
{"text": "Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;"}
{"text": "No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself."}
{"text": "The door is open, sir; there lies your way;"}
{"text": "You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;"}
{"text": "For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:"}
{"text": "'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,"}
{"text": "That take it on you at the first so roundly."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I will be angry: what hast thou to do?"}
{"text": "Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work."}
{"text": "KATARINA:"}
{"text": "Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:"}
{"text": "I see a woman may be made a fool,"}
{"text": "If she had not a spirit to resist."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command."}
{"text": "Obey the bride, you that attend on her;"}
{"text": "Go to the feast, revel and domineer,"}
{"text": "Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,"}
{"text": "Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:"}
{"text": "But for my bonny Kate, she must with me."}
{"text": "Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;"}
{"text": "I will be master of what is mine own:"}
{"text": "She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,"}
{"text": "My household stuff, my field, my barn,"}
{"text": "My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;"}
{"text": "And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;"}
{"text": "I'll bring mine action on the proudest he"}
{"text": "That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,"}
{"text": "Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;"}
{"text": "Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man."}
{"text": "Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch"}
{"text": "thee, Kate:"}
{"text": "I'll buckler thee against a million."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Of all mad matches never was the like."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "That, being mad herself, she's madly mated."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Neighbours and friends, though bride and"}
{"text": "bridegroom wants"}
{"text": "For to supply the places at the table,"}
{"text": "You know there wants no junkets at the feast."}
{"text": "Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:"}
{"text": "And let Bianca take her sister's room."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and"}
{"text": "all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever"}
{"text": "man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent"}
{"text": "before to make a fire, and they are coming after to"}
{"text": "warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon"}
{"text": "hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my"}
{"text": "tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my"}
{"text": "belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but"}
{"text": "I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,"}
{"text": "considering the weather, a taller man than I will"}
{"text": "take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Who is that calls so coldly?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide"}
{"text": "from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run"}
{"text": "but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast"}
{"text": "on no water."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou"}
{"text": "knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it"}
{"text": "hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and"}
{"text": "myself, fellow Curtis."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and"}
{"text": "so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a"}
{"text": "fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,"}
{"text": "whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon"}
{"text": "feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and"}
{"text": "therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for"}
{"text": "my master and mistress are almost frozen to death."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as"}
{"text": "will thaw."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Come, you are so full of cony-catching!"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold."}
{"text": "Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house"}
{"text": "trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the"}
{"text": "serving-men in their new fustian, their white"}
{"text": "stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?"}
{"text": "Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,"}
{"text": "the carpets laid, and every thing in order?"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "First, know, my horse is tired; my master and"}
{"text": "mistress fallen out."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "How?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby"}
{"text": "hangs a tale."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Let's ha't, good Grumio."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Lend thine ear."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Here."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "There."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this"}
{"text": "cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech"}
{"text": "listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a"}
{"text": "foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Both of one horse?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "What's that to thee?"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Why, a horse."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,"}
{"text": "thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she"}
{"text": "under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how"}
{"text": "miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her"}
{"text": "with the horse upon her, how he beat me because"}
{"text": "her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt"}
{"text": "to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,"}
{"text": "that never prayed before, how I cried, how the"}
{"text": "horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I"}
{"text": "lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,"}
{"text": "which now shall die in oblivion and thou return"}
{"text": "unexperienced to thy grave."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "By this reckoning he is more shrew than she."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall"}
{"text": "find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?"}
{"text": "Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,"}
{"text": "Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be"}
{"text": "sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their"}
{"text": "garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy"}
{"text": "with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair"}
{"text": "of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their"}
{"text": "hands. Are they all ready?"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "They are."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Call them forth."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to"}
{"text": "countenance my mistress."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Why, she hath a face of her own."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "Who knows not that?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Thou, it seems, that calls for company to"}
{"text": "countenance her."}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "I call them forth to credit her."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them."}
{"text": "NATHANIEL:"}
{"text": "Welcome home, Grumio!"}
{"text": "PHILIP:"}
{"text": "How now, Grumio!"}
{"text": "JOSEPH:"}
{"text": "What, Grumio!"}
{"text": "NICHOLAS:"}
{"text": "Fellow Grumio!"}
{"text": "NATHANIEL:"}
{"text": "How now, old lad?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,"}
{"text": "you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce"}
{"text": "companions, is all ready, and all things neat?"}
{"text": "NATHANIEL:"}
{"text": "All things is ready. How near is our master?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be"}
{"text": "not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Where be these knaves? What, no man at door"}
{"text": "To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!"}
{"text": "Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?"}
{"text": "ALL SERVING-MEN:"}
{"text": "Here, here, sir; here, sir."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!"}
{"text": "You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!"}
{"text": "What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?"}
{"text": "Where is the foolish knave I sent before?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Here, sir; as foolish as I was before."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!"}
{"text": "Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,"}
{"text": "And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,"}
{"text": "And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;"}
{"text": "There was no link to colour Peter's hat,"}
{"text": "And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:"}
{"text": "There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;"}
{"text": "The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;"}
{"text": "Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in."}
{"text": "Where is the life that late I led--"}
{"text": "Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--"}
{"text": "Sound, sound, sound, sound!"}
{"text": "Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry."}
{"text": "Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?"}
{"text": "It was the friar of orders grey,"}
{"text": "As he forth walked on his way:--"}
{"text": "Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:"}
{"text": "Take that, and mend the plucking off the other."}
{"text": "Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!"}
{"text": "Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,"}
{"text": "And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:"}
{"text": "One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with."}
{"text": "Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?"}
{"text": "Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily."}
{"text": "You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!"}
{"text": "Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach."}
{"text": "Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?"}
{"text": "What's this? mutton?"}
{"text": "First Servant:"}
{"text": "Ay."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Who brought it?"}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "I."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat."}
{"text": "What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?"}
{"text": "How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,"}
{"text": "And serve it thus to me that love it not?"}
{"text": "Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;"}
{"text": "You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!"}
{"text": "What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:"}
{"text": "The meat was well, if you were so contented."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;"}
{"text": "And I expressly am forbid to touch it,"}
{"text": "For it engenders choler, planteth anger;"}
{"text": "And better 'twere that both of us did fast,"}
{"text": "Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,"}
{"text": "Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh."}
{"text": "Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,"}
{"text": "And, for this night, we'll fast for company:"}
{"text": "Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber."}
{"text": "NATHANIEL:"}
{"text": "Peter, didst ever see the like?"}
{"text": "PETER:"}
{"text": "He kills her in her own humour."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Where is he?"}
{"text": "CURTIS:"}
{"text": "In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;"}
{"text": "And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,"}
{"text": "Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,"}
{"text": "And sits as one new-risen from a dream."}
{"text": "Away, away! for he is coming hither."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Thus have I politicly begun my reign,"}
{"text": "And 'tis my hope to end successfully."}
{"text": "My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;"}
{"text": "And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,"}
{"text": "For then she never looks upon her lure."}
{"text": "Another way I have to man my haggard,"}
{"text": "To make her come and know her keeper's call,"}
{"text": "That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites"}
{"text": "That bate and beat and will not be obedient."}
{"text": "She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;"}
{"text": "Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;"}
{"text": "As with the meat, some undeserved fault"}
{"text": "I'll find about the making of the bed;"}
{"text": "And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,"}
{"text": "This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:"}
{"text": "Ay, and amid this hurly I intend"}
{"text": "That all is done in reverend care of her;"}
{"text": "And in conclusion she shall watch all night:"}
{"text": "And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl"}
{"text": "And with the clamour keep her still awake."}
{"text": "This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;"}
{"text": "And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour."}
{"text": "He that knows better how to tame a shrew,"}
{"text": "Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca"}
{"text": "Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?"}
{"text": "I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,"}
{"text": "Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "What, master, read you? first resolve me that."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I read that I profess, the Art to Love."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "And may you prove, sir, master of your art!"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,"}
{"text": "You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca"}
{"text": "Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!"}
{"text": "I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Mistake no more: I am not Licio,"}
{"text": "Nor a musician, as I seem to be;"}
{"text": "But one that scorn to live in this disguise,"}
{"text": "For such a one as leaves a gentleman,"}
{"text": "And makes a god of such a cullion:"}
{"text": "Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Signior Hortensio, I have often heard"}
{"text": "Of your entire affection to Bianca;"}
{"text": "And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,"}
{"text": "I will with you, if you be so contented,"}
{"text": "Forswear Bianca and her love for ever."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,"}
{"text": "Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow"}
{"text": "Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,"}
{"text": "As one unworthy all the former favours"}
{"text": "That I have fondly flatter'd her withal."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And here I take the unfeigned oath,"}
{"text": "Never to marry with her though she would entreat:"}
{"text": "Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!"}
{"text": "For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,"}
{"text": "I will be married to a wealthy widow,"}
{"text": "Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me"}
{"text": "As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard."}
{"text": "And so farewell, Signior Lucentio."}
{"text": "Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,"}
{"text": "Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,"}
{"text": "In resolution as I swore before."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace"}
{"text": "As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!"}
{"text": "Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,"}
{"text": "And have forsworn you with Hortensio."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Mistress, we have."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Then we are rid of Licio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,"}
{"text": "That shall be wood and wedded in a day."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "God give him joy!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, and he'll tame her."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "He says so, Tranio."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "The taming-school! what, is there such a place?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;"}
{"text": "That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,"}
{"text": "To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "O master, master, I have watch'd so long"}
{"text": "That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied"}
{"text": "An ancient angel coming down the hill,"}
{"text": "Will serve the turn."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "What is he, Biondello?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,"}
{"text": "I know not what; but format in apparel,"}
{"text": "In gait and countenance surely like a father."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And what of him, Tranio?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "If he be credulous and trust my tale,"}
{"text": "I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,"}
{"text": "And give assurance to Baptista Minola,"}
{"text": "As if he were the right Vincentio"}
{"text": "Take in your love, and then let me alone."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "God save you, sir!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "And you, sir! you are welcome."}
{"text": "Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:"}
{"text": "But then up farther, and as for as Rome;"}
{"text": "And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "What countryman, I pray?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Of Mantua."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!"}
{"text": "And come to Padua, careless of your life?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis death for any one in Mantua"}
{"text": "To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?"}
{"text": "Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,"}
{"text": "For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,"}
{"text": "Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:"}
{"text": "'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,"}
{"text": "You might have heard it else proclaim'd about."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;"}
{"text": "For I have bills for money by exchange"}
{"text": "From Florence and must here deliver them."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Well, sir, to do you courtesy,"}
{"text": "This will I do, and this I will advise you:"}
{"text": "First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,"}
{"text": "Pisa renowned for grave citizens."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Among them know you one Vincentio?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "I know him not, but I have heard of him;"}
{"text": "A merchant of incomparable wealth."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,"}
{"text": "In countenance somewhat doth resemble you."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "To save your life in this extremity,"}
{"text": "This favour will I do you for his sake;"}
{"text": "And think it not the worst of an your fortunes"}
{"text": "That you are like to Sir Vincentio."}
{"text": "His name and credit shall you undertake,"}
{"text": "And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:"}
{"text": "Look that you take upon you as you should;"}
{"text": "You understand me, sir: so shall you stay"}
{"text": "Till you have done your business in the city:"}
{"text": "If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "O sir, I do; and will repute you ever"}
{"text": "The patron of my life and liberty."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Then go with me to make the matter good."}
{"text": "This, by the way, I let you understand;"}
{"text": "my father is here look'd for every day,"}
{"text": "To pass assurance of a dower in marriage"}
{"text": "'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:"}
{"text": "In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:"}
{"text": "Go with me to clothe you as becomes you."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:"}
{"text": "What, did he marry me to famish me?"}
{"text": "Beggars, that come unto my father's door,"}
{"text": "Upon entreaty have a present aims;"}
{"text": "If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:"}
{"text": "But I, who never knew how to entreat,"}
{"text": "Nor never needed that I should entreat,"}
{"text": "Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,"}
{"text": "With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:"}
{"text": "And that which spites me more than all these wants,"}
{"text": "He does it under name of perfect love;"}
{"text": "As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,"}
{"text": "'Twere deadly sickness or else present death."}
{"text": "I prithee go and get me some repast;"}
{"text": "I care not what, so it be wholesome food."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "What say you to a neat's foot?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I fear it is too choleric a meat."}
{"text": "How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric."}
{"text": "What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "A dish that I do love to feed upon."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,"}
{"text": "Or else you get no beef of Grumio."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Why then, the mustard without the beef."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,"}
{"text": "That feed'st me with the very name of meat:"}
{"text": "Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,"}
{"text": "That triumph thus upon my misery!"}
{"text": "Go, get thee gone, I say."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Mistress, what cheer?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Faith, as cold as can be."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me."}
{"text": "Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am"}
{"text": "To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:"}
{"text": "I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks."}
{"text": "What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;"}
{"text": "And all my pains is sorted to no proof."}
{"text": "Here, take away this dish."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I pray you, let it stand."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "The poorest service is repaid with thanks;"}
{"text": "And so shall mine, before you touch the meat."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I thank you, sir."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame."}
{"text": "Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Haberdasher:"}
{"text": "Here is the cap your worship did bespeak."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, this was moulded on a porringer;"}
{"text": "A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:"}
{"text": "Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,"}
{"text": "A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:"}
{"text": "Away with it! come, let me have a bigger."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,"}
{"text": "And gentlewomen wear such caps as these"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "When you are gentle, you shall have one too,"}
{"text": "And not till then."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;"}
{"text": "And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:"}
{"text": "Your betters have endured me say my mind,"}
{"text": "And if you cannot, best you stop your ears."}
{"text": "My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,"}
{"text": "Or else my heart concealing it will break,"}
{"text": "And rather than it shall, I will be free"}
{"text": "Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,"}
{"text": "A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:"}
{"text": "I love thee well, in that thou likest it not."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Love me or love me not, I like the cap;"}
{"text": "And it I will have, or I will have none."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't."}
{"text": "O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?"}
{"text": "What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:"}
{"text": "What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?"}
{"text": "Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,"}
{"text": "Like to a censer in a barber's shop:"}
{"text": "Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "You bid me make it orderly and well,"}
{"text": "According to the fashion and the time."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,"}
{"text": "I did not bid you mar it to the time."}
{"text": "Go, hop me over every kennel home,"}
{"text": "For you shall hop without my custom, sir:"}
{"text": "I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,"}
{"text": "More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:"}
{"text": "Belike you mean to make a puppet of me."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "She says your worship means to make"}
{"text": "a puppet of her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,"}
{"text": "thou thimble,"}
{"text": "Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!"}
{"text": "Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!"}
{"text": "Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?"}
{"text": "Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;"}
{"text": "Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard"}
{"text": "As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!"}
{"text": "I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "Your worship is deceived; the gown is made"}
{"text": "Just as my master had direction:"}
{"text": "Grumio gave order how it should be done."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "But how did you desire it should be made?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Marry, sir, with needle and thread."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "But did you not request to have it cut?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Thou hast faced many things."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "I have."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not"}
{"text": "me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto"}
{"text": "thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did"}
{"text": "not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Read it."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in"}
{"text": "the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom"}
{"text": "of brown thread: I said a gown."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Proceed."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I confess the cape."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I confess two sleeves."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, there's the villany."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill."}
{"text": "I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and"}
{"text": "sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,"}
{"text": "though thy little finger be armed in a thimble."}
{"text": "Tailor:"}
{"text": "This is true that I say: an I had thee"}
{"text": "in place where, thou shouldst know it."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "I am for thee straight: take thou the"}
{"text": "bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Go, take it up unto thy master's use."}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'"}
{"text": "gown for thy master's use!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?"}
{"text": "GRUMIO:"}
{"text": "O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:"}
{"text": "Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!"}
{"text": "O, fie, fie, fie!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:"}
{"text": "Take no unkindness of his hasty words:"}
{"text": "Away! I say; commend me to thy master."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's"}
{"text": "Even in these honest mean habiliments:"}
{"text": "Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;"}
{"text": "For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;"}
{"text": "And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,"}
{"text": "So honour peereth in the meanest habit."}
{"text": "What is the jay more precious than the lark,"}
{"text": "Because his fathers are more beautiful?"}
{"text": "Or is the adder better than the eel,"}
{"text": "Because his painted skin contents the eye?"}
{"text": "O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse"}
{"text": "For this poor furniture and mean array."}
{"text": "if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;"}
{"text": "And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,"}
{"text": "To feast and sport us at thy father's house."}
{"text": "Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;"}
{"text": "And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;"}
{"text": "There will we mount, and thither walk on foot"}
{"text": "Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,"}
{"text": "And well we may come there by dinner-time."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;"}
{"text": "And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "It shall be seven ere I go to horse:"}
{"text": "Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,"}
{"text": "You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:"}
{"text": "I will not go to-day; and ere I do,"}
{"text": "It shall be what o'clock I say it is."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Ay, what else? and but I be deceived"}
{"text": "Signior Baptista may remember me,"}
{"text": "Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,"}
{"text": "Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,"}
{"text": "With such austerity as 'longeth to a father."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "I warrant you."}
{"text": "But, sir, here comes your boy;"}
{"text": "'Twere good he were school'd."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,"}
{"text": "Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:"}
{"text": "Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Tut, fear not me."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I told him that your father was at Venice,"}
{"text": "And that you look'd for him this day in Padua."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink."}
{"text": "Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir."}
{"text": "Signior Baptista, you are happily met."}
{"text": "Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:"}
{"text": "I pray you stand good father to me now,"}
{"text": "Give me Bianca for my patrimony."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Soft son!"}
{"text": "Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua"}
{"text": "To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio"}
{"text": "Made me acquainted with a weighty cause"}
{"text": "Of love between your daughter and himself:"}
{"text": "And, for the good report I hear of you"}
{"text": "And for the love he beareth to your daughter"}
{"text": "And she to him, to stay him not too long,"}
{"text": "I am content, in a good father's care,"}
{"text": "To have him match'd; and if you please to like"}
{"text": "No worse than I, upon some agreement"}
{"text": "Me shall you find ready and willing"}
{"text": "With one consent to have her so bestow'd;"}
{"text": "For curious I cannot be with you,"}
{"text": "Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:"}
{"text": "Your plainness and your shortness please me well."}
{"text": "Right true it is, your son Lucentio here"}
{"text": "Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,"}
{"text": "Or both dissemble deeply their affections:"}
{"text": "And therefore, if you say no more than this,"}
{"text": "That like a father you will deal with him"}
{"text": "And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,"}
{"text": "The match is made, and all is done:"}
{"text": "Your son shall have my daughter with consent."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best"}
{"text": "We be affied and such assurance ta'en"}
{"text": "As shall with either part's agreement stand?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,"}
{"text": "Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:"}
{"text": "Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;"}
{"text": "And happily we might be interrupted."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Then at my lodging, an it like you:"}
{"text": "There doth my father lie; and there, this night,"}
{"text": "We'll pass the business privately and well."}
{"text": "Send for your daughter by your servant here:"}
{"text": "My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently."}
{"text": "The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,"}
{"text": "You are like to have a thin and slender pittance."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,"}
{"text": "And bid Bianca make her ready straight;"}
{"text": "And, if you will, tell what hath happened,"}
{"text": "Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,"}
{"text": "And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I pray the gods she may with all my heart!"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone."}
{"text": "Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?"}
{"text": "Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:"}
{"text": "Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "I follow you."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Cambio!"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What sayest thou, Biondello?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Biondello, what of that?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to"}
{"text": "expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I pray thee, moralize them."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the"}
{"text": "deceiving father of a deceitful son."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And what of him?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And then?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your"}
{"text": "command at all hours."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "And what of all this?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a"}
{"text": "counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,"}
{"text": "'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the"}
{"text": "church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient"}
{"text": "honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,"}
{"text": "I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for"}
{"text": "ever and a day."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Hearest thou, Biondello?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an"}
{"text": "afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to"}
{"text": "stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,"}
{"text": "sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint"}
{"text": "Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against"}
{"text": "you come with your appendix."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I may, and will, if she be so contented:"}
{"text": "She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?"}
{"text": "Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:"}
{"text": "It shall go hard if Cambio go without her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's."}
{"text": "Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I say it is the moon that shines so bright."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I know it is the sun that shines so bright."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,"}
{"text": "It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,"}
{"text": "Or ere I journey to your father's house."}
{"text": "Go on, and fetch our horses back again."}
{"text": "Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Say as he says, or we shall never go."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,"}
{"text": "And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:"}
{"text": "An if you please to call it a rush-candle,"}
{"text": "Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I say it is the moon."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "I know it is the moon."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:"}
{"text": "But sun it is not, when you say it is not;"}
{"text": "And the moon changes even as your mind."}
{"text": "What you will have it named, even that it is;"}
{"text": "And so it shall be so for Katharina."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,"}
{"text": "And not unluckily against the bias."}
{"text": "But, soft! company is coming here."}
{"text": "Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?"}
{"text": "Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,"}
{"text": "Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?"}
{"text": "Such war of white and red within her cheeks!"}
{"text": "What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,"}
{"text": "As those two eyes become that heavenly face?"}
{"text": "Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee."}
{"text": "Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,"}
{"text": "Whither away, or where is thy abode?"}
{"text": "Happy the parents of so fair a child;"}
{"text": "Happier the man, whom favourable stars"}
{"text": "Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:"}
{"text": "This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,"}
{"text": "And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,"}
{"text": "That have been so bedazzled with the sun"}
{"text": "That everything I look on seemeth green:"}
{"text": "Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;"}
{"text": "Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known"}
{"text": "Which way thou travellest: if along with us,"}
{"text": "We shall be joyful of thy company."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,"}
{"text": "That with your strange encounter much amazed me,"}
{"text": "My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;"}
{"text": "And bound I am to Padua; there to visit"}
{"text": "A son of mine, which long I have not seen."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "What is his name?"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Lucentio, gentle sir."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Happily we met; the happier for thy son."}
{"text": "And now by law, as well as reverend age,"}
{"text": "I may entitle thee my loving father:"}
{"text": "The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,"}
{"text": "Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,"}
{"text": "Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,"}
{"text": "Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;"}
{"text": "Beside, so qualified as may beseem"}
{"text": "The spouse of any noble gentleman."}
{"text": "Let me embrace with old Vincentio,"}
{"text": "And wander we to see thy honest son,"}
{"text": "Who will of thy arrival be full joyous."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,"}
{"text": "Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest"}
{"text": "Upon the company you overtake?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I do assure thee, father, so it is."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;"}
{"text": "For our first merriment hath made thee jealous."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart."}
{"text": "Have to my widow! and if she be froward,"}
{"text": "Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee"}
{"text": "at home; therefore leave us."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and"}
{"text": "then come back to my master's as soon as I can."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "I marvel Cambio comes not all this while."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:"}
{"text": "My father's bears more toward the market-place;"}
{"text": "Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "You shall not choose but drink before you go:"}
{"text": "I think I shall command your welcome here,"}
{"text": "And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "They're busy within; you were best knock louder."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to"}
{"text": "make merry withal?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall"}
{"text": "need none, so long as I live."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua."}
{"text": "Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,"}
{"text": "I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is"}
{"text": "come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here"}
{"text": "looking out at the window."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Art thou his father?"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to"}
{"text": "cozen somebody in this city under my countenance."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I have seen them in the church together: God send"}
{"text": "'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old"}
{"text": "master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Hope I may choose, sir."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I"}
{"text": "never saw you before in all my life."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see"}
{"text": "thy master's father, Vincentio?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:"}
{"text": "see where he looks out of the window."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Is't so, indeed."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of"}
{"text": "this controversy."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal"}
{"text": "gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet"}
{"text": "hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I"}
{"text": "am undone! I am undone! while I play the good"}
{"text": "husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at"}
{"text": "the university."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "How now! what's the matter?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "What, is the man lunatic?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your"}
{"text": "habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,"}
{"text": "what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I"}
{"text": "thank my good father, I am able to maintain it."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do"}
{"text": "you think is his name?"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought"}
{"text": "him up ever since he was three years old, and his"}
{"text": "name is Tranio."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is"}
{"text": "mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold"}
{"text": "on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my"}
{"text": "son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?"}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Call forth an officer."}
{"text": "Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,"}
{"text": "I charge you see that he be forthcoming."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Carry me to the gaol!"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be"}
{"text": "cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this"}
{"text": "is the right Vincentio."}
{"text": "Pedant:"}
{"text": "Swear, if thou darest."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, I dare not swear it."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O"}
{"text": "monstrous villain!"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,"}
{"text": "forswear him, or else we are all undone."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Lives my sweet son?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}

{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "How hast thou offended?"}
{"text": "Where is Lucentio?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Here's Lucentio,"}
{"text": "Right son to the right Vincentio;"}
{"text": "That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,"}
{"text": "While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Where is that damned villain Tranio,"}
{"text": "That faced and braved me in this matter so?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Cambio is changed into Lucentio."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love"}
{"text": "Made me exchange my state with Tranio,"}
{"text": "While he did bear my countenance in the town;"}
{"text": "And happily I have arrived at the last"}
{"text": "Unto the wished haven of my bliss."}
{"text": "What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;"}
{"text": "Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent"}
{"text": "me to the gaol."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter"}
{"text": "without asking my good will?"}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but"}
{"text": "I will in, to be revenged for this villany."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "And I, to sound the depth of this knavery."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown."}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,"}
{"text": "Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "First kiss me, Kate, and we will."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "What, in the midst of the street?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "What, art thou ashamed of me?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:"}
{"text": "Better once than never, for never too late."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:"}
{"text": "And time it is, when raging war is done,"}
{"text": "To smile at scapes and perils overblown."}
{"text": "My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,"}
{"text": "While I with self-same kindness welcome thine."}
{"text": "Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,"}
{"text": "And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,"}
{"text": "Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:"}
{"text": "My banquet is to close our stomachs up,"}
{"text": "After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;"}
{"text": "For now we sit to chat as well as eat."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Padua affords nothing but what is kind."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "For both our sakes, I would that word were true."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Then never trust me, if I be afeard."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:"}
{"text": "I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "He that is giddy thinks the world turns round."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Roundly replied."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Mistress, how mean you that?"}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Thus I conceive by him."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "My widow says, thus she conceives her tale."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'"}
{"text": "I pray you, tell me what you meant by that."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,"}
{"text": "Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:"}
{"text": "And now you know my meaning,"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "A very mean meaning."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Right, I mean you."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "And I am mean indeed, respecting you."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "To her, Kate!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "To her, widow!"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "That's my office."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Believe me, sir, they butt together well."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body"}
{"text": "Would say your head and butt were head and horn."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,"}
{"text": "Have at you for a bitter jest or two!"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;"}
{"text": "And then pursue me as you draw your bow."}
{"text": "You are welcome all."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio."}
{"text": "This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;"}
{"text": "Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,"}
{"text": "Which runs himself and catches for his master."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A good swift simile, but something currish."}
{"text": "TRANIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:"}
{"text": "'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;"}
{"text": "And, as the jest did glance away from me,"}
{"text": "'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,"}
{"text": "I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance"}
{"text": "Let's each one send unto his wife;"}
{"text": "And he whose wife is most obedient"}
{"text": "To come at first when he doth send for her,"}
{"text": "Shall win the wager which we will propose."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Content. What is the wager?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Twenty crowns."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Twenty crowns!"}
{"text": "I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,"}
{"text": "But twenty times so much upon my wife."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "A hundred then."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Content."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "A match! 'tis done."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Who shall begin?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "That will I."}
{"text": "Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me."}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "I go."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself."}
{"text": "How now! what news?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "Sir, my mistress sends you word"}
{"text": "That she is busy and she cannot come."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "How! she is busy and she cannot come!"}
{"text": "Is that an answer?"}
{"text": "GREMIO:"}
{"text": "Ay, and a kind one too:"}
{"text": "Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I hope better."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife"}
{"text": "To come to me forthwith."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "O, ho! entreat her!"}
{"text": "Nay, then she must needs come."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I am afraid, sir,"}
{"text": "Do what you can, yours will not be entreated."}
{"text": "Now, where's my wife?"}
{"text": "BIONDELLO:"}
{"text": "She says you have some goodly jest in hand:"}
{"text": "She will not come: she bids you come to her."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,"}
{"text": "Intolerable, not to be endured!"}
{"text": "Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;"}
{"text": "Say, I command her to come to me."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "I know her answer."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "What?"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "She will not."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "The fouler fortune mine, and there an end."}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "What is your will, sir, that you send for me?"}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?"}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "They sit conferring by the parlor fire."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come."}
{"text": "Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:"}
{"text": "Away, I say, and bring them hither straight."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder."}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "And so it is: I wonder what it bodes."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,"}
{"text": "And awful rule and right supremacy;"}
{"text": "And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?"}
{"text": "BAPTISTA:"}
{"text": "Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!"}
{"text": "The wager thou hast won; and I will add"}
{"text": "Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;"}
{"text": "Another dowry to another daughter,"}
{"text": "For she is changed, as she had never been."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, I will win my wager better yet"}
{"text": "And show more sign of her obedience,"}
{"text": "Her new-built virtue and obedience."}
{"text": "See where she comes and brings your froward wives"}
{"text": "As prisoners to her womanly persuasion."}
{"text": "Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:"}
{"text": "Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,"}
{"text": "Till I be brought to such a silly pass!"}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?"}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "I would your duty were as foolish too:"}
{"text": "The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,"}
{"text": "Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time."}
{"text": "BIANCA:"}
{"text": "The more fool you, for laying on my duty."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women"}
{"text": "What duty they do owe their lords and husbands."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come on, I say; and first begin with her."}
{"text": "Widow:"}
{"text": "She shall not."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "I say she shall: and first begin with her."}
{"text": "KATHARINA:"}
{"text": "Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,"}
{"text": "And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,"}
{"text": "To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:"}
{"text": "It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,"}
{"text": "Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,"}
{"text": "And in no sense is meet or amiable."}
{"text": "A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,"}
{"text": "Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;"}
{"text": "And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty"}
{"text": "Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it."}
{"text": "Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,"}
{"text": "Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,"}
{"text": "And for thy maintenance commits his body"}
{"text": "To painful labour both by sea and land,"}
{"text": "To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,"}
{"text": "Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;"}
{"text": "And craves no other tribute at thy hands"}
{"text": "But love, fair looks and true obedience;"}
{"text": "Too little payment for so great a debt."}
{"text": "Such duty as the subject owes the prince"}
{"text": "Even such a woman oweth to her husband;"}
{"text": "And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,"}
{"text": "And not obedient to his honest will,"}
{"text": "What is she but a foul contending rebel"}
{"text": "And graceless traitor to her loving lord?"}
{"text": "I am ashamed that women are so simple"}
{"text": "To offer war where they should kneel for peace;"}
{"text": "Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,"}
{"text": "When they are bound to serve, love and obey."}
{"text": "Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,"}
{"text": "Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,"}
{"text": "But that our soft conditions and our hearts"}
{"text": "Should well agree with our external parts?"}
{"text": "Come, come, you froward and unable worms!"}
{"text": "My mind hath been as big as one of yours,"}
{"text": "My heart as great, my reason haply more,"}
{"text": "To bandy word for word and frown for frown;"}
{"text": "But now I see our lances are but straws,"}
{"text": "Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,"}
{"text": "That seeming to be most which we indeed least are."}
{"text": "Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,"}
{"text": "And place your hands below your husband's foot:"}
{"text": "In token of which duty, if he please,"}
{"text": "My hand is ready; may it do him ease."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't."}
{"text": "VINCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis a good hearing when children are toward."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "But a harsh hearing when women are froward."}
{"text": "PETRUCHIO:"}
{"text": "Come, Kate, we'll to bed."}
{"text": "We three are married, but you two are sped."}
{"text": "'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;"}
{"text": "And, being a winner, God give you good night!"}
{"text": "HORTENSIO:"}
{"text": "Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew."}
{"text": "LUCENTIO:"}
{"text": "'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so."}
{"text": "Master:"}
{"text": "Boatswain!"}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Here, master: what cheer?"}
{"text": "Master:"}
{"text": "Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,"}
{"text": "or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!"}
{"text": "yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the"}
{"text": "master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,"}
{"text": "if room enough!"}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?"}
{"text": "Play the men."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "I pray now, keep below."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Where is the master, boatswain?"}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your"}
{"text": "cabins: you do assist the storm."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Nay, good, be patient."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers"}
{"text": "for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "None that I more love than myself. You are a"}
{"text": "counsellor; if you can command these elements to"}
{"text": "silence, and work the peace of the present, we will"}
{"text": "not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you"}
{"text": "cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make"}
{"text": "yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of"}
{"text": "the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out"}
{"text": "of our way, I say."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he"}
{"text": "hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is"}
{"text": "perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his"}
{"text": "hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,"}
{"text": "for our own doth little advantage. If he be not"}
{"text": "born to be hanged, our case is miserable."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring"}
{"text": "her to try with main-course."}
{"text": "A plague upon this howling! they are louder than"}
{"text": "the weather or our office."}
{"text": "Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er"}
{"text": "and drown? Have you a mind to sink?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,"}
{"text": "incharitable dog!"}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Work you then."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!"}
{"text": "We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were"}
{"text": "no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an"}
{"text": "unstanched wench."}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to"}
{"text": "sea again; lay her off."}
{"text": "Mariners:"}
{"text": "All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!"}
{"text": "Boatswain:"}
{"text": "What, must our mouths be cold?"}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,"}
{"text": "For our case is as theirs."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "I'm out of patience."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:"}
{"text": "This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning"}
{"text": "The washing of ten tides!"}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "He'll be hang'd yet,"}
{"text": "Though every drop of water swear against it"}
{"text": "And gape at widest to glut him."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Let's all sink with the king."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Let's take leave of him."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an"}
{"text": "acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any"}
{"text": "thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain"}
{"text": "die a dry death."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "If by your art, my dearest father, you have"}
{"text": "Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."}
{"text": "The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,"}
{"text": "But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,"}
{"text": "Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered"}
{"text": "With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,"}
{"text": "Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,"}
{"text": "Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock"}
{"text": "Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd."}
{"text": "Had I been any god of power, I would"}
{"text": "Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere"}
{"text": "It should the good ship so have swallow'd and"}
{"text": "The fraughting souls within her."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Be collected:"}
{"text": "No more amazement: tell your piteous heart"}
{"text": "There's no harm done."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "O, woe the day!"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "No harm."}
{"text": "I have done nothing but in care of thee,"}
{"text": "Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who"}
{"text": "Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing"}
{"text": "Of whence I am, nor that I am more better"}
{"text": "Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,"}
{"text": "And thy no greater father."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "More to know"}
{"text": "Did never meddle with my thoughts."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "'Tis time"}
{"text": "I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,"}
{"text": "And pluck my magic garment from me. So:"}
{"text": "Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort."}
{"text": "The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd"}
{"text": "The very virtue of compassion in thee,"}
{"text": "I have with such provision in mine art"}
{"text": "So safely ordered that there is no soul--"}
{"text": "No, not so much perdition as an hair"}
{"text": "Betid to any creature in the vessel"}
{"text": "Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;"}
{"text": "For thou must now know farther."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "You have often"}
{"text": "Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd"}
{"text": "And left me to a bootless inquisition,"}
{"text": "Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "The hour's now come;"}
{"text": "The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;"}
{"text": "Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember"}
{"text": "A time before we came unto this cell?"}
{"text": "I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not"}
{"text": "Out three years old."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Certainly, sir, I can."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "By what? by any other house or person?"}
{"text": "Of any thing the image tell me that"}
{"text": "Hath kept with thy remembrance."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "'Tis far off"}
{"text": "And rather like a dream than an assurance"}
{"text": "That my remembrance warrants. Had I not"}
{"text": "Four or five women once that tended me?"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it"}
{"text": "That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else"}
{"text": "In the dark backward and abysm of time?"}
{"text": "If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,"}
{"text": "How thou camest here thou mayst."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "But that I do not."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,"}
{"text": "Thy father was the Duke of Milan and"}
{"text": "A prince of power."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Sir, are not you my father?"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and"}
{"text": "She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father"}
{"text": "Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir"}
{"text": "And princess no worse issued."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "O the heavens!"}
{"text": "What foul play had we, that we came from thence?"}
{"text": "Or blessed was't we did?"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Both, both, my girl:"}
{"text": "By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,"}

{"text": "Through all the signories it was the first"}
{"text": "And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed"}
{"text": "In dignity, and for the liberal arts"}
{"text": "Without a parallel; those being all my study,"}
{"text": "The government I cast upon my brother"}
{"text": "And to my state grew stranger, being transported"}

{"text": "Dost thou attend me?"}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Sir, most heedfully."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Being once perfected how to grant suits,"}

{"text": "Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,"}
{"text": "Like a good parent, did beget of him"}
{"text": "A falsehood in its contrary as great"}
{"text": "As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,"}
{"text": "A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,"}
{"text": "Not only with what my revenue yielded,"}
{"text": "But what my power might else exact, like one"}
{"text": "Who having into truth, by telling of it,"}
{"text": "Made such a sinner of his memory,"}

{"text": "Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "To have no screen between this part he play'd"}

{"text": "In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,"}
{"text": "Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared"}
{"text": "A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,"}

{"text": "Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil"}
{"text": "Would not infect his reason?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Not a soul"}
{"text": "But felt a fever of the mad and play'd"}
{"text": "Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners"}

{"text": "Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,"}
{"text": "With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--"}

{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Why that's my spirit!"}
{"text": "But was not this nigh shore?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Close by, my master."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "But are they, Ariel, safe?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Not a hair perish'd;"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Safely in harbour"}

{"text": "Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew"}
{"text": "From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:"}

{"text": "What is the time o' the day?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Past the mid season."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,"}
{"text": "Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "My liberty."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "I prithee,"}
{"text": "Remember I have done thee worthy service;"}
{"text": "Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served"}
{"text": "Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise"}

{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Dost thou forget"}
{"text": "From what a torment I did free thee?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "No."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze"}
{"text": "Of the salt deep,"}

{"text": "To do me business in the veins o' the earth"}
{"text": "When it is baked with frost."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "I do not, sir."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot"}
{"text": "The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy"}
{"text": "Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?"}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "No, sir."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Sir, in Argier."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "O, was she so? I must"}
{"text": "Once in a month recount what thou hast been,"}

{"text": "For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible"}
{"text": "To enter human hearing, from Argier,"}
{"text": "Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Ay, sir."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child"}
{"text": "And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,"}
{"text": "As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;"}

{"text": "To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,"}
{"text": "Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,"}
{"text": "By help of her more potent ministers"}
{"text": "And in her most unmitigable rage,"}
{"text": "Into a cloven pine; within which rift"}
{"text": "Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain"}
{"text": "A dozen years; within which space she died"}
{"text": "And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans"}
{"text": "As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--"}
{"text": "Save for the son that she did litter here,"}
{"text": "A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with"}
{"text": "A human shape."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Yes, Caliban her son."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban"}
{"text": "Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st"}
{"text": "What torment I did find thee in; thy groans"}
{"text": "Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts"}
{"text": "Of ever angry bears: it was a torment"}
{"text": "To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax"}
{"text": "Could not again undo: it was mine art,"}
{"text": "When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape"}
{"text": "The pine and let thee out."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "I thank thee, master."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak"}
{"text": "And peg thee in his knotty entrails till"}

{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "Pardon, master;"}
{"text": "I will be correspondent to command"}
{"text": "And do my spiriting gently."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Do so, and after two days"}
{"text": "I will discharge thee."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "That's my noble master!"}
{"text": "What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject"}
{"text": "To no sight but thine and mine, invisible"}

{"text": "Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!"}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "The strangeness of your story put"}

{"text": "Thou earth, thou! speak."}
{"text": "CALIBAN:"}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:"}
{"text": "Come, thou tortoise! when?"}
{"text": "Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,"}
{"text": "Hark in thine ear."}
{"text": "ARIEL:"}
{"text": "My lord it shall be done."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself"}
{"text": "Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!"}

{"text": "Water with berries in't, and teach me how"}
{"text": "To name the bigger light, and how the less,"}
{"text": "That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee"}
{"text": "And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,"}
{"text": "The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:"}
{"text": "Cursed be I that did so! All the charms"}
{"text": "Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!"}

{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou most lying slave,"}
{"text": "Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,"}

{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses"}
{"text": "As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest"}
{"text": "Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd"}
{"text": "With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him"}

{"text": "That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp"}
{"text": "The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself"}
{"text": "Upon this island as a spy, to win it"}
{"text": "From me, the lord on't."}
{"text": "FERDINAND:"}
{"text": "No, as I am a man."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:"}
{"text": "If the ill spirit have so fair a house,"}
{"text": "Good things will strive to dwell with't."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Follow me."}
{"text": "Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;"}
{"text": "I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:"}
{"text": "Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be"}
{"text": "The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks"}
{"text": "Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow."}
{"text": "FERDINAND:"}
{"text": "No;"}
{"text": "I will resist such entertainment till"}
{"text": "Mine enemy has more power."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "O dear father,"}
{"text": "Make not too rash a trial of him, for"}
{"text": "He's gentle and not fearful."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "What? I say,"}
{"text": "My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;"}
{"text": "Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience"}
{"text": "Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,"}
{"text": "For I can here disarm thee with this stick"}
{"text": "And make thy weapon drop."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Beseech you, father."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Hence! hang not on my garments."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Sir, have pity;"}
{"text": "I'll be his surety."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Silence! one word more"}
{"text": "Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!"}
{"text": "An advocate for an imposter! hush!"}
{"text": "Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,"}
{"text": "Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!"}
{"text": "To the most of men this is a Caliban"}
{"text": "And they to him are angels."}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "My affections"}
{"text": "Are then most humble; I have no ambition"}
{"text": "To see a goodlier man."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Come on; obey:"}
{"text": "Thy nerves are in their infancy again"}
{"text": "And have no vigour in them."}
{"text": "FERDINAND:"}
{"text": "So they are;"}
{"text": "My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up."}
{"text": "My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,"}
{"text": "The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,"}
{"text": "To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,"}
{"text": "Might I but through my prison once a day"}
{"text": "Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth"}
{"text": "Let liberty make use of; space enough"}
{"text": "Have I in such a prison."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "MIRANDA:"}
{"text": "Be of comfort;"}
{"text": "My father's of a better nature, sir,"}
{"text": "Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted"}
{"text": "Which now came from him."}
{"text": "PROSPERO:"}
{"text": "Thou shalt be free"}

{"text": "Come, follow. Speak not for him."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,"}
{"text": "So have we all, of joy; for our escape"}
{"text": "Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe"}
{"text": "Is common; every day some sailor's wife,"}
{"text": "The masters of some merchant and the merchant"}
{"text": "Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,"}
{"text": "I mean our preservation, few in millions"}
{"text": "Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh"}
{"text": "Our sorrow with our comfort."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "Prithee, peace."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "He receives comfort like cold porridge."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "The visitor will not give him o'er so."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;"}
{"text": "by and by it will strike."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Sir,--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "One: tell."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,"}
{"text": "Comes to the entertainer--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "A dollar."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Dolour comes to him, indeed: you"}
{"text": "have spoken truer than you purposed."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Therefore, my lord,--"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!"}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "I prithee, spare."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Well, I have done: but yet,--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "He will be talking."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Which, of he or Adrian, for a good"}
{"text": "wager, first begins to crow?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "The old cock."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "The cockerel."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Done. The wager?"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "A laughter."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "A match!"}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "Though this island seem to be desert,--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid."}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Yet,--"}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "Yet,--"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "He could not miss't."}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate"}
{"text": "temperance."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Temperance was a delicate wench."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered."}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "The air breathes upon us here most sweetly."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "As if it had lungs and rotten ones."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Here is everything advantageous to life."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "True; save means to live."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Of that there's none, or little."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "The ground indeed is tawny."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "With an eye of green in't."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "He misses not much."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "No; he doth but mistake the truth totally."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost"}
{"text": "beyond credit,--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "As many vouched rarities are."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in"}
{"text": "the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and"}
{"text": "glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with"}
{"text": "salt water."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not"}
{"text": "say he lies?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report"}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we"}
{"text": "put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of"}
{"text": "the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return."}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to"}
{"text": "their queen."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Not since widow Dido's time."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?"}
{"text": "widow Dido!"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,"}
{"text": "how you take it!"}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:"}
{"text": "she was of Carthage, not of Tunis."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "This Tunis, sir, was Carthage."}
{"text": "ADRIAN:"}
{"text": "Carthage?"}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I assure you, Carthage."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath"}
{"text": "raised the wall and houses too."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "What impossible matter will he make easy next?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "I think he will carry this island home in his pocket"}
{"text": "and give it his son for an apple."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring"}
{"text": "forth more islands."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Ay."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Why, in good time."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now"}
{"text": "as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage"}
{"text": "of your daughter, who is now queen."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "And the rarest that e'er came there."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I"}
{"text": "wore it? I mean, in a sort."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "That sort was well fished for."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?"}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "You cram these words into mine ears against"}
{"text": "The stomach of my sense. Would I had never"}
{"text": "Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,"}
{"text": "My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,"}
{"text": "Who is so far from Italy removed"}
{"text": "I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir"}
{"text": "Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish"}
{"text": "Hath made his meal on thee?"}
{"text": "FRANCISCO:"}
{"text": "Sir, he may live:"}
{"text": "I saw him beat the surges under him,"}
{"text": "And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,"}
{"text": "Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted"}
{"text": "The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head"}
{"text": "'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd"}
{"text": "Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke"}
{"text": "To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,"}
{"text": "As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt"}
{"text": "He came alive to land."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "No, no, he's gone."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,"}
{"text": "That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,"}
{"text": "But rather lose her to an African;"}
{"text": "Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,"}
{"text": "Who hath cause to wet the grief on't."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "Prithee, peace."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise"}
{"text": "By all of us, and the fair soul herself"}
{"text": "Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at"}
{"text": "Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your"}
{"text": "son,"}
{"text": "I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have"}
{"text": "More widows in them of this business' making"}
{"text": "Than we bring men to comfort them:"}
{"text": "The fault's your own."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "So is the dear'st o' the loss."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "My lord Sebastian,"}
{"text": "The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness"}
{"text": "And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,"}
{"text": "When you should bring the plaster."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Very well."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "And most chirurgeonly."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "It is foul weather in us all, good sir,"}
{"text": "When you are cloudy."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Foul weather?"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Very foul."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "He'ld sow't with nettle-seed."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Or docks, or mallows."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "And were the king on't, what would I do?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "'Scape being drunk for want of wine."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I' the commonwealth I would by contraries"}
{"text": "Execute all things; for no kind of traffic"}
{"text": "Would I admit; no name of magistrate;"}
{"text": "Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,"}
{"text": "And use of service, none; contract, succession,"}
{"text": "Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;"}
{"text": "No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;"}
{"text": "No occupation; all men idle, all;"}
{"text": "And women too, but innocent and pure;"}
{"text": "No sovereignty;--"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Yet he would be king on't."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the"}
{"text": "beginning."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "All things in common nature should produce"}
{"text": "Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,"}
{"text": "Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,"}
{"text": "Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,"}
{"text": "Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,"}
{"text": "To feed my innocent people."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "No marrying 'mong his subjects?"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "None, man; all idle: whores and knaves."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I would with such perfection govern, sir,"}
{"text": "To excel the golden age."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "God save his majesty!"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Long live Gonzalo!"}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "And,--do you mark me, sir?"}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "I do well believe your highness; and"}
{"text": "did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,"}
{"text": "who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that"}
{"text": "they always use to laugh at nothing."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "'Twas you we laughed at."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing"}
{"text": "to you: so you may continue and laugh at"}
{"text": "nothing still."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "What a blow was there given!"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "An it had not fallen flat-long."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift"}
{"text": "the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue"}
{"text": "in it five weeks without changing."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "We would so, and then go a bat-fowling."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Nay, good my lord, be not angry."}
{"text": "GONZALO:"}
{"text": "No, I warrant you; I will not adventure"}
{"text": "my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh"}
{"text": "me asleep, for I am very heavy?"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Go sleep, and hear us."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes"}
{"text": "Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find"}
{"text": "They are inclined to do so."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Please you, sir,"}
{"text": "Do not omit the heavy offer of it:"}
{"text": "It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,"}
{"text": "It is a comforter."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "We two, my lord,"}
{"text": "Will guard your person while you take your rest,"}
{"text": "And watch your safety."}
{"text": "ALONSO:"}
{"text": "Thank you. Wondrous heavy."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "What a strange drowsiness possesses them!"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "It is the quality o' the climate."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "Why"}
{"text": "Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not"}
{"text": "Myself disposed to sleep."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Nor I; my spirits are nimble."}
{"text": "They fell together all, as by consent;"}
{"text": "They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,"}
{"text": "Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--"}
{"text": "And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,"}
{"text": "What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and"}
{"text": "My strong imagination sees a crown"}
{"text": "Dropping upon thy head."}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "What, art thou waking?"}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Do you not hear me speak?"}
{"text": "SEBASTIAN:"}
{"text": "I do; and surely"}
{"text": "It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st"}
{"text": "Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?"}
{"text": "This is a strange repose, to be asleep"}
{"text": "With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,"}
{"text": "And yet so fast asleep."}
{"text": "ANTONIO:"}
{"text": "Noble Sebastian,"}
{"text": "Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st"}
{"text": "Whiles thou art waking."}
